# TERMINOLOGY AND GLOSSARY

## Glossary Terms Are Canonical

If a glossary is provided below, these represent community-approved translations. Use these exact forms as the base for all occurrences, adapting only for grammatical inflection (plurals, possessives, etc.) while keeping the core term identical.

## Compound Terms (CRITICAL)

When translating compound terms that contain a glossary word, you MUST use the glossary translation for the component term.

Examples:
- If "staking" → "staking" in the glossary
- Then "staking pool" → use "staking" + translated "pool"
- And "staking rewards" → use "staking" + translated "rewards"
- And "participate in staking" → use "staking" as the base

Do NOT use creative alternatives for compound terms. The glossary term must appear consistently everywhere it's used, whether standalone or as part of a phrase.

## Related Phrases

Apply glossary terms consistently across all grammatical contexts:
- "staking pools" and "staking with a pool" should use the same root translation for "staking" and "pool"
- "validator rewards" and "rewards for validators" should use the same root translations

## Use Consistent Terminology

Reuse prior translations for repeated terms unless context demands a change.

## No Glossary Available?

If no glossary is provided, pick a clear translation for each term and keep it consistent throughout the document.

## Technical Terms

Do not translate highly specific blockchain terms such as "smart contract", "gas", "dapp", or other Ethereum jargon unless there is a widely accepted equivalent. When in doubt, leave the term in English.

## Avoid Invented Conjugations

When translating English verbs derived from nouns (like "to stake", "to mint", "to bridge"), prefer natural phrasal constructions in the target language (e.g., "hacer staking", "realizar mint") over invented verb conjugations that may sound like slang. Use forms that would be understood by a general audience, not just crypto-native speakers.
