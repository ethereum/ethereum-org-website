You are listening to "What is Web 3?" page.

Centralization has helped onboard billions of people to the World Wide Web and created the stable, robust infrastructure on which it lives. At the same time, a handful of centralized entities have a stronghold on large swathes of the World Wide Web, unilaterally deciding what should and should not be allowed.

Web3 is the answer to this dilemma. Instead of a Web monopolized by large technology companies, Web3 embraces decentralization and is being built, operated, and owned by its users. Web3 puts power in the hands of individuals rather than corporations. Before we talk about Web3, let's explore how we got here.

The internet as we know it has evolved significantly over time. The web's journey can be divided into three main eras:

Web 1.0, from 1990 to 2004, was known as the "Read-Only" web. Websites were static, and users could only consume content.

Web 2.0, from 2004 to present, became the "Read-Write" web. Social media emerged, allowing users to create content and interact. However, large companies controlled most of the platforms and user data.

Now, we're entering Web3, or the "Read-Write-Own" era. Web3 represents a vision for a better internet built on blockchain technology, where users have true ownership and control. With this new vision of the internet, the are some core principals that guide its creation.

First, it's decentralized. Instead of big companies controlling everything, ownership is distributed among users and builders.

Second, it's permissionless. Everyone can participate in Web3, with no exclusions.

Third, it has native payments built-in through cryptocurrencies, eliminating the need for traditional banking infrastructure.

Fourth, it's trustless, operating through economic incentives rather than relying on third parties.

These core principals have allowed for some amazing features during web3's development as well.

True digital ownership through NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) allows users to truly own digital assets. Unlike Web2 where your in-game items or digital art are controlled by companies, Web3 lets you own, sell, and transfer digital assets as easily as physical ones.

Censorship resistance ensures content creators can't be silenced by centralized platforms. Once content is published on the blockchain, it becomes permanent and immutable, giving creators true freedom of expression.

DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) represent a new way of organizing communities and businesses. These digital-native organizations are owned and managed by their members, using smart contracts for transparent governance and decision-making.

Digital identity in Web3 puts users in control of their personal data. Instead of having your identity scattered across different platforms, Web3 allows for self-sovereign identity where you decide what information to share.

Native payments through cryptocurrencies enable borderless, instant transactions without intermediaries. This opens up new economic opportunities and makes financial services accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

While there have been many advances and improvements to the web through Web3, there are several challenges we are faced with as well.

Important Web3 features, like Sign-in with Ethereum, are already available for anyone to use at zero cost. But, the relative cost of transactions is still prohibitive to many. Web3 is less likely to be utilized in less-wealthy, developing nations due to high transaction fees. On Ethereum, these challenges are being solved through the roadmap and layer 2 scaling solutions.

The technical barrier to entry to using Web3 is currently too high. Users must comprehend security concerns, understand complex technical documentation, and navigate unintuitive user interfaces.

Web3 introduces new paradigms that require learning different mental models than the ones used in Web2.0. A similar education drive happened as Web1.0 was gaining popularity in the late 1990s; proponents of the world wide web used a slew of educational techniques to educate the public from simple metaphors (the information highway, browsers, surfing the web) to television broadcasts(opens in a new tab). Web3 isn't difficult, but it is different. Educational initiatives informing Web2 users of these Web3 paradigms are vital for its success.

The Web3 ecosystem is young and quickly evolving. As a result, it currently depends mainly on centralized infrastructure (GitHub, Twitter, Discord, etc.). Many Web3 companies are rushing to fill these gaps, but building high-quality, reliable infrastructure takes time.

Despite these challenges, Web3 represents an exciting future for the internet - one where users have more control, ownership, and freedom.
