Ethereum is the main platform for thousands of applications and blockchains, all powered by the Ethereum protocol. This vibrant ecosystem fuels innovation and a wide range of decentralized applications and services.

One of Ethereum's standout features is its ability to provide banking for anyone. In a world where not everyone has access to traditional financial services, Ethereum breaks down barriers by offering lending, borrowing, and savings products that are accessible with just an internet connection. This inclusivity opens up financial opportunities to individuals worldwide, regardless of their location or background.

Ethereum also champions an open internet. It empowers anyone to interact with its network or build applications on top of it. This decentralization means that you have control over your own assets and identity, rather than relying on a handful of large corporations. By removing these centralized entities, Ethereum fosters a more equitable and transparent digital landscape.

Let's explore the key differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin, two of the most prominent names in the cryptocurrency world. Launched in 2015, Ethereum builds upon the innovations introduced by Bitcoin but introduces some significant distinctions. Both Ethereum and Bitcoin allow you to use digital money without the need for payment providers or banks. However, Ethereum offers something more—it's programmable.

This programmability means you can build and deploy decentralized applications, or dApps, right on the Ethereum network. Think of Bitcoin as a digital currency that lets you send and receive money without intermediaries. It's excellent for establishing value and handling transactions independently of traditional financial systems. On the other hand, Ethereum extends this functionality. Instead of just facilitating transactions, Ethereum allows you to write and execute any kind of program or contract. There's virtually no limit to the types of contracts you can create, which fosters a high level of innovation on the Ethereum network. While Bitcoin primarily serves as a payment network, focusing on digital money transactions, Ethereum functions more like a versatile marketplace. On Ethereum, you can find a wide array of financial services, games, social networks, and other applications all operating seamlessly together. This flexibility makes Ethereum a hub for diverse and innovative applications that go beyond just transferring digital currency.

To understand Ethereum, it's essential to grasp the fundamentals of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. A blockchain is a database of transactions that is updated and shared across many computers in a network. Every time a new set of transactions is added, its called a “block” - hence the name blockchain. Public blockchains like Ethereum allow anyone to add, but not remove, data. If someone wanted to alter any of the information or cheat the system, they’d need to do so on the majority of validators on the network. That is a lot! This makes decentralized blockchains like Ethereum highly secure.

Cryptocurrency is a term used to describe many types of fungible digital tokens secured using a blockchain. The reason assets such as bitcoin and ether are called “cryptocurrencies” is that the security of your data and assets is guaranteed by cryptography, not by trusting an institution or corporation to act honestly. Ethereum has its own native cryptocurrency, ether also known as eath, which is used to pay for certain activities on the network. It can be transferred to other users or swapped for other tokens on Ethereum. Ether is special because it is used to pay for the computation required to build and run apps and organizations on Ethereum.

Ethereum isn't controlled by any single organization or entity. Instead, it thrives on a network of connected computers, each running software that follows the Ethereum protocol and contributes to the blockchain. These computers are known as nodes, and anyone can operate one. In order to secure the network you will need to stake Ether, and can run a validator without permission. Even the Ethereum source code is not produced by a single entity. Anyone can suggest changes to the protocol and discuss upgrades. There are several implementations of the Ethereum protocol that are produced by independent organizations in several programming languages, and they are usually built in the open and encourage community contributions.

Applications on Ethereum use smart contracts which are computer programs living on the Ethereum blockchain. They make Ethereum very flexible in what it can do. These programs act as building blocks for decentralized apps and organizations. Popular examples of smart contracts are lending apps, decentralized trading exchanges, insurance, quadratic funding, social networks, NFTs - basically anything you can think of.

On September 15, 2022, Ethereum underwent a significant upgrade known as The Merge. This upgrade marked Ethereum's transition from a proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake mechanism. The Merge stands as Ethereum's most substantial upgrade to date. It slashed the energy consumption required to secure the Ethereum network by an impressive 99.95%. This dramatic reduction not only makes Ethereum more environmentally friendly by lowering its carbon footprint but also enhances the network's security and scalability. With this transition, Ethereum has become a low-carbon blockchain, paving the way for a sustainable and robust future.


Operating as a peer-to-peer network, Ethereum allows you to coordinate, make agreements, or transfer digital assets directly with others without the need for intermediaries. This direct interaction not only streamlines processes but also reduces costs and increases efficiency in transactions and collaborations.

Another significant advantage of Ethereum is its censorship-resistant nature. No government or company holds control over the Ethereum network, making it nearly impossible for anyone to prevent you from receiving payments or using services. This resilience ensures that your financial activities remain secure and uninterrupted.

When it comes to commerce, Ethereum offers built-in guarantees that enhance trust between customers and developers. Customers can rest assured that funds will only be exchanged if the agreed-upon conditions are met, while developers can be confident that the rules governing their applications will remain consistent and unaltered.

Lastly, Ethereum supports composable products, meaning all applications are built on the same blockchain with a shared global state. Think of it like Lego bricks—each app can build upon others, creating more complex and robust solutions. This interoperability not only leads to better products and user experiences but also ensures that essential tools and services remain accessible and cannot be removed by any single entity.

So, Why Would I Use Ethereum? If you're looking for more resilient, open, and trustworthy ways to collaborate on a global scale, build organizations, create applications, or share value, Ethereum is the platform for you. Ethereum isn't just a technology—it's a collective story that we all contribute to. Join us and explore the incredible worlds we can create together. Ethereum has also been a lifeline for individuals who have faced uncertainty regarding the security, reliability, or flexibility of their assets due to factors beyond their control. By providing a decentralized and secure environment, Ethereum empowers people to manage their assets with confidence, free from external pressures and restrictions.
