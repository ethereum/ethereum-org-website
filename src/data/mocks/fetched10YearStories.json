One of the most significant differences Ethereum made in my community - the web3 Warri - was bringing together individuals with no background in blockchain and transforming them into smart contracts developers. Ethereum has helped my community - the web3 Warri - overcome some of these challenges 1. Centralization: Members of my community now understand that they have control over how they use the internet and their data 2. Seamless and cross-border payments: Most members of my community work as freelancers and remote workers. And receiving their payments have already been a challenger but with Ethereum, they have been able to receive their payments via stable coins and in almost an instance. 3. They also don't need to provide numerous documents to support their identity in making and receiving payments.",
