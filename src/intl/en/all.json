    "staking-solo-5-c-label": "~50%",
    "staking-solo-5-c-explanation": "Validators are penalized approximately 75% of what they would have been rewarded for correctly and promptly attesting to the state of the chain. This means for a given time period, being offline 50% of that time will still be net profitable, albeit less profitable than a more reliably available validator.",
    "staking-solo-5-d-label": "~25%",
    "staking-solo-5-d-explanation": "A validator with only 25% uptime will be incurring penalties for the other 75% of the time. Given the similar size of rewards and penalties, being offline for 3x the amount of time online will result in a net loss of ETH for that time period.",
    "staking-solo-6-prompt": "Which of the following is NOT a slashable offense?",
    "staking-solo-6-a-label": "Being offline",
    "staking-solo-6-a-explanation": "Simply being offline does not result in slashing. It will result in small inactivity penalties while offline, but will resume attesting when back online.",

    "staking-solo-7-c-explanation": "Using the same client as a majority of the rest of the network puts you at risk for being slashed in the event of a software bug in that client. Running a minority client protects against this.",
    "staking-solo-7-d-label": "Disable validator for 2-4 epochs before migrating keys to a new machine",

    "run-a-node-4-d-explanation": "At time of writing, a 2 TB SSD drive should satisfy the storage and read/write speed requirements for a full Ethereum node. An 8 TB SSD would allow for more future-proofing, and the ability to also sync layer 2 chains, but is not currently a requirement for Mainnet.",
    "run-a-node-5-prompt": "What happens if your node goes offline?",
    "run-a-node-5-a-label": "Your node drops out of sync with the current state of the network",
    "run-a-node-5-a-explanation": "When your node is not available online, it is unable to receive new transactions and blocks from peers, and as such falls out-of-sync with the current state of the chain. Connecting back online will allow your node software to get synced back up to be fully functional again.",
    "run-a-node-5-b-label": "The ETH in your cold storage is slashed",
    "run-a-node-5-b-explanation": "ETH held in your cold storage has nothing to do with your node being online or not. If your node is offline, you won't be able to use it to look up the latest balance of your accounts, but being offline does not put your secured funds at risk. If you're also running validator software with your node as a staker, small penalties will be incurred to this validator balance while unavailable to the network.",
    "run-a-node-5-c-label": "The energy used looking for proof-of-work is wasted",
    "run-a-node-5-c-explanation": "Ethereum no longer uses proof-of-work, and this was never a requirement of all node operators. Being offline simply means your node is no longer in sync with the latest changes on the network, and can re-sync by returning online.",
    "run-a-node-5-d-label": "Chain data is removed, and re-syncing from scratch is required",
    "run-a-node-5-d-explanation": "Simply going offline does not typically delete any saved chain data. Connecting back to the internet will allow the software to resume where it left off to sync up with the latest transactions.",
    "run-a-node-6-prompt": "Running a node earns network rewards",
    "run-a-node-6-a-label": "True",
    "run-a-node-6-a-explanation": "Simply running client software does not earn you rewards. To earn rewards, you must also be staking.",
    "run-a-node-6-b-label": "False",
    "stablecoins-1-prompt": "What are stablecoins?",
    "stablecoins-1-a-label": "Cryptocurrencies with low price volatility, their value is steady and similar to traditional currencies",
    "stablecoins-1-a-explanation": "Correct! Stablecoins are designed to address the volatility issue common in many cryptocurrencies.",
    "stablecoins-1-b-label": "Digital representations of gold",
    "stablecoins-1-b-explanation": "This is incorrect. While some stablecoins might be backed by precious metals, they can also be backed by fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies.",
    "stablecoins-1-c-label": "A new type of credit card",
    "stablecoins-1-c-explanation": "This is incorrect. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency, not a credit card.",
    "stablecoins-1-d-label": "A replacement for ether",
    "stablecoins-1-d-explanation": "This is incorrect. Stablecoins are not designed to replace ether (ETH). They are another token on the Ethereum network designed to maintain steady value over time.",
    "stablecoins-2-prompt": "Which of the following is a stablecoin?",
    "stablecoins-2-a-label": "US Dollar",
    "stablecoins-2-a-explanation": "This is incorrect. While stablecoins can represent the US dollar, a US dollar is not a cryptocurrency.",
    "stablecoins-2-b-label": "AAVE token",
    "stablecoins-2-b-explanation": "This is incorrect. AAVE is a governance token for the Aave protocol, which provides marketplaces for stablecoins, but AAVE itself is not a stablecoin.",
    "stablecoins-2-c-label": "Dai",
    "stablecoins-2-c-explanation": "Correct! Dai is probably the most famous decentralized stablecoin, and its value is roughly 1 US Dollar.",
    "stablecoins-2-d-label": "Ether",
    "stablecoins-2-d-explanation": "This is incorrect. Ether is the native currency of the Ethereum network, but it is not intended to be stable.",
    "stablecoins-3-prompt": "What can stablecoins be used for?",
    "stablecoins-3-a-label": "To protect its users from volatile changes in price",
    "stablecoins-3-a-explanation": "Not quite. This answer is partially correct, but it's only one of the many things stablecoins can be used for.",
    "stablecoins-3-b-label": "To buy things on the internet anywhere in the world",
    "stablecoins-3-b-explanation": "Not quite. This answer is partially correct, but it's only one of the many things stablecoins can be used for.",
    "stablecoins-3-c-label": "To earn money by lending to others",
    "stablecoins-3-c-explanation": "Not quite. This answer is partially correct, but it's only one of the many things stablecoins can be used for.",
    "stablecoins-3-d-label": "All of the above",
    "stablecoins-3-d-explanation": "Correct! Stablecoins can be used to hold cryptocurrency with less volatility, transact globally on the internet, and earn interest when you lend them out.",
    "stablecoins-4-prompt": "What makes stablecoins unique?",
    "stablecoins-4-a-label": "It is a token that is tied to an asset in the real world",
    "stablecoins-4-a-explanation": "This is incorrect. While many stablecoins are pegged to real-world assets, this characteristic is not exclusive to stablecoins (e.g., ETH-collateralized tokens).",
    "stablecoins-4-b-label": "It is a cryptocurrency token specifically designed to keep its value steady",
    "stablecoins-4-b-explanation": "Correct! Stablecoins are designed to keep their value relatively stable, typically pegged to assets like currencies (e.g., 1 USDC = 1 US dollar), but not all stablecoins follow this model (e.g., RAI).",
    "stablecoins-4-c-label": "It is capable of being sent over the internet",
    "stablecoins-4-c-explanation": "This is incorrect. While this is a capability, it is not unique to stablecoins.",
    "stablecoins-4-d-label": "It can be used on the Ethereum network.",
    "stablecoins-4-d-explanation": "This is incorrect. Many other cryptocurrency tokens can be used on the Ethereum network.",
    "stablecoins-5-prompt": "What is NOT a way to get stablecoins?",
    "stablecoins-5-a-label": "Swap them with other tokens",
    "stablecoins-5-a-explanation": "Incorrect, this is a way to get stablecoins. One of the most common ways people acquire stablecoins is by swapping their existing cryptocurrencies for stablecoins.",
    "stablecoins-5-b-label": "Borrow them",
    "stablecoins-5-b-explanation": "Incorrect, this is a way to get stablecoins. You can borrow some stablecoins by using your existing cryptocurrencies, such as ether, as collateral. You will need to pay the borrowed stablecoins back to reclaim your locked collateral.",
    "stablecoins-5-c-label": "Buy them from an exchange",
    "stablecoins-5-c-explanation": "Incorrect, this is a way to get stablecoins. Many exchanges and wallets let you buy stablecoins directly. Geographical restrictions may apply for centralized exchanges.",
    "stablecoins-5-d-label": "Mine them",
    "stablecoins-5-d-explanation": "Correct! Unlike bitcoin, you are unable to mine stablecoins.",
    "defi-1-prompt": "What does DeFi stand for?",
    "defi-1-a-label": "Decentralized Finance",
    "defi-1-a-explanation": "Correct! DeFi refers to Decentralized Finance, a financial system built on Ethereum that operates without intermediaries like banks or financial institutions.",
    "defi-1-b-label": "Digital Finance",
    "defi-1-b-explanation": "This is incorrect. Digital Finance refers to financial services that are provided through digital platforms, but it doesn’t specifically imply decentralization.",
    "defi-1-c-label": "Distributed Finance",
    "defi-1-c-explanation": "This is incorrect. While 'distributed' could imply decentralization, the term used in the industry is 'Decentralized Finance,' not Distributed Finance.",
    "defi-1-d-label": "Development Finance",
    "defi-1-d-explanation": "This is incorrect. Development Finance typically refers to financial support provided for projects aimed at economic development, often in developing countries, and is unrelated to blockchain or DeFi.",
    "defi-2-prompt": "What CAN'T you do with DeFi?",
    "defi-2-a-label": "Send money around the globe.",
    "defi-2-a-explanation": "This is incorrect. With DeFi, you can send value to anybody anywhere in the world, without any limits.",
    "defi-2-b-label": "Ask customer support to revert your mistakes.",
    "defi-2-b-explanation": "Correct! In DeFi, transactions are final and controlled by code rather than a company. If a mistake happens, like sending funds to the wrong address, there’s no customer support to help fix it. You need to be extra careful.",
    "defi-2-c-label": "Borrow funds with collateral.",
    "defi-2-c-explanation": "This is incorrect. With DeFi, you can borrow money instantly, avoiding the days-long approval process of traditional banks.",
    "defi-2-d-label": "Trade your tokens 24/7.",
    "defi-2-d-explanation": "This is incorrect. DeFi allows you to trade tokens 24/7. Markets are always open, and you can trade your ETH against USDT or any other currency anytime.",
    "defi-3-prompt": "Which DeFi platform is known for allowing users to swap tokens directly with one another?",
    "defi-3-a-label": "Uniswap",
    "defi-3-a-explanation": "Correct! Uniswap is a decentralized exchange that allows users to trade (swap) tokens directly with each other using automated market-making mechanisms.",
    "defi-3-b-label": "Aave",
    "defi-3-b-explanation": "This is incorrect. Aave is a DeFi protocol focused on lending and borrowing, not token swaps.",
    "defi-3-c-label": "PoolTogether",
    "defi-3-c-explanation": "This is incorrect. PoolTogether runs no-loss lotteries which offer a new innovative way to save money.",
    "defi-3-d-label": "MakerDao",
    "defi-3-d-explanation": "This is incorrect. MakerDAO is a decentralized platform that allows users to issue and manage the DAI stablecoin, but it doesn’t focus on token swaps.",
    "defi-4-prompt": "When you use a DeFi app and make a transaction, where is the transaction information kept?",
    "defi-4-a-label": "ETH",
    "defi-4-a-explanation": "This is incorrect. Data is not stored in ether (ETH). ETH is the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain.",
    "defi-4-b-label": "My wallet",
    "defi-4-b-explanation": "This is incorrect. A wallet is an application that manages your Ethereum account by connecting to the Ethereum blockchain. It doesn't store any data about your transaction history.",
    "defi-4-c-label": "DeFi apps",
    "defi-4-c-explanation": "This is incorrect. DeFi apps don’t store your transaction history directly. Instead, your transaction details are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.",
    "defi-4-d-label": "Ethereum blockchain",
    "defi-4-d-explanation": "Correct! Ethereum as a blockchain stores all the data made by its users and apps. This allows validators to maintain the same state across the P2P network.",
    "defi-5-prompt": "What makes Decentralized Finance (DeFi) possible on Ethereum?",
    "defi-5-a-label": "Smart Contracts",
    "defi-5-a-explanation": "Correct! Smart contracts are like digital 'if-then' statements written into Ethereum. They replace traditional contracts and middlemen, automatically executing transactions if certain conditions are met.",
    "defi-5-b-label": "Middlemen",
    "defi-5-b-explanation": "This is incorrect. Ethereum doesn't need middlemen for transactions to run. Everything runs on the chain through smart contracts.",
    "defi-5-c-label": "Bitcoin",
    "defi-5-c-explanation": "This is incorrect. Bitcoin is a simple network for storing value, not for running advanced programs. DeFi requires a more flexible system, like Ethereum, that can run complex programs to handle loans and trades automatically.",
    "defi-5-d-label": "Traditional financial institutions",
    "defi-5-d-explanation": "This is incorrect. DeFi apps don’t need traditional financial institutions. They use blockchain programs called smart contracts to handle transactions automatically."

    "page-layer-2-faq-ExpandableCard-1-description-1": "There are many different ways one can categorize networks in relation to Ethereum. Many networks claim to be scaling Ethereum to gather popularity. However, one clear perspective is whether the network stores its data on the Ethereum main network. This greatly enhances user security and Ethereum's permissionless vision. Such projects are often called “rollups”. If data is stored somewhere else, then the project is not a direct Ethereum extension and is rather independent. Check out some of the most popular",
    "page-layer-2-faq-ExpandableCard-1-description-2": "Some specific industries might not require such direct close relationship such as gaming or non-financial applications where different technologies are better fit.",

    "page-layer-2-faq-ExpandableCard-3-description": "Ethereum can't easily scale its own main chain because it needs to stay secure and decentralized. Making the main chain faster could make it less secure and more centralized. Ethereum networks help by processing transactions off the main chain and then using the main chain for security, allowing Ethereum to handle more transactions without losing security or decentralization.",
    "page-layer-2-faq-ExpandableCard-4-title": "Why is there no 'official' Ethereum networks?",
    "page-layer-2-faq-ExpandableCard-4-description": "Just as there is no 'official' Ethereum client, there is no 'official' Ethereum layer 2. Ethereum is permissionless - technically anyone can create a layer 2! Multiple teams will implement their version of a layer 2, and the ecosystem as a whole will benefit from a diversity of design approaches that are optimized for different use cases.

    "page-staking-comparison-solo-saas": "With SaaS providers you're still required to deposit 32 ETH, but don't have to run hardware. You typically maintain access to your validator keys, but also need to share your signing keys so the operator can act on behalf of your validator. This introduces a layer of trust not present when running your own hardware, and unlike solo staking at home, SaaS does not help as much with geographic distribution of nodes. If you're uncomfortable operating hardware but still looking to stake 32 ETH, using a SaaS provider may be a good option for you.",
    "page-staking-comparison-solo-pools": "Solo staking is significantly more involved than staking with a pooling service, but offers full access to ETH rewards, and full control over the setup and security of your validator. Pooled staking has a significantly lower barrier to entry. Users can stake small amounts of ETH, are not required to generate validator keys, and have no hardware requirements beyond a standard internet connection. Liquidity tokens enable the ability to exit from staking before this is enabled at the protocol level. If you're interested in these features, pooled staking may be a good fit.",
    "page-staking-comparison-saas-solo": "Similarities include having your own validator keys without having to pool funds, but with SaaS you must trust a third-party, who may potentially act maliciously or become a target of attack or regulation themselves. If these trust assumptions or centralization risks concern you, the gold standard of self-sovereign staking is solo staking.",
    "page-staking-comparison-saas-pools": "These are similar in that you're generally relying on someone else to run the validator client, but unlike SaaS, pooled staking allows you to participate with smaller amounts of ETH. If you're looking to stake with less than 32 ETH, consider checking these out.",
    "page-staking-comparison-pools-solo": "Pooled staking has a significantly lower barrier to entry when compared to home staking, but comes with additional risk by delegating all node operations to a third-party, and with a fee. Home staking gives full sovereignty and control over the choices that go into choosing a staking setup. Stakers never have to hand over their keys, and they earn full rewards without any middlemen taking a cut.",
    "page-staking-comparison-pools-saas": "These are similar in that stakers do not run the validator software themselves, but unlike pooling options, SaaS requires a full 32 ETH deposit to activate a validator. Rewards accumulate to the staker, and usually involve a monthly fee or other stake to use the service. If you'd prefer your own validator keys and are looking to stake at least 32 ETH, using a SaaS provider may be a good option for you.",

    "page-staking-faq-1-answer": "A <em>validator</em> is a virtual entity that lives on Ethereum and participates in the consensus of the Ethereum protocol. Validators are represented by a balance, public key, and other properties. A <em>validator client</em> is the software that acts on behalf of the validator by holding and using its private key. A single validator client can hold many key pairs, controlling many validators.",
    "page-staking-faq-2-question": "Why do I need to have funds at stake?",
    "page-staking-faq-2-answer": "A validator has the ability to propose and attest to blocks for the network. To prevent dishonest behavior, users must have their funds at stake. This allows the protocol to penalize malicious actors. Staking is a means to keep you honest, as your actions will have financial consequences.",
    "page-staking-faq-3-question": "Can I buy 'Eth2'?",
    "page-staking-faq-3-answer-p1": "There is no 'Eth2' token native to the protocol, as the native token ether (ETH) did not change when Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake.",
    "page-staking-faq-3-answer-p2": "There are derivative tokens/tickers that may represent staked ETH (ie. rETH from Rocket Pool, stETH from Lido, ETH2 from Coinbase). Learn more about <a href=\"/staking/pools/\">staking pools</a>",
    "page-staking-faq-4-question": "Is staking already live?",
    "page-staking-faq-4-answer-p1": "Yes. Staking has been live since December 1, 2020",
    "page-staking-faq-4-answer-p2": "This means that staking is currently live for users to deposit their ETH, run a validator client, and start earning rewards.",
    "page-staking-faq-4-answer-p3": "The Shanghai/Capella upgrade was completed April 12, 2023, enabling staking withdrawals, closing the loop on staking liquidity.",
    "page-staking-faq-5-question": "When can I withdraw my staked ETH?",
    "page-staking-faq-5-answer-p1": "Right now! Stakers are free to withdraw their rewards and/or principle deposit from their validator balance if they choose.",
    "page-staking-faq-5-answer-p2": "Stakers will also earn rewards in the form of fees and MEV when proposing blocks, which are made available immediately via the set fee recipient address.",

    "page-upgrades-question-10-answer-7": "The plans around Phase 2 have been a point of intense research and discussion. With The Merge behind us, and the advancements in layer 2 solutions, goals have shifted to provide a more simplified form of data sharding to maximize rollup efficiency.
