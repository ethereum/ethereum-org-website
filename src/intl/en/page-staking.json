  "page-staking-hierarchy-subtext": "As you may have noticed, there are many ways to participate in Ethereum staking. These paths target a wide range of users and ultimately are each unique and vary in terms of risks, rewards, and trust assumptions. Some are more decentralized, battle-tested and/or risky than others. We provide some information on popular projects in the space, but <em>always do your own research</em> before sending ETH anywhere.",
  "page-staking-comparison-solo-saas": "With SaaS providers you're still required to deposit 32 ETH, but don't have to run hardware. You typically maintain access to your validator keys, but also need to share your signing keys so the operator can act on behalf of your validator. This introduces a layer of trust not present when running your own hardware, and unlike solo staking at home, SaaS does not help as much with geographic distribution of nodes. If you're uncomfortable operating hardware but still looking to stake 32 ETH, using a SaaS provider may be a good option for you.",
  "page-staking-comparison-solo-pools": "Solo staking is significantly more involved than staking with a pooling service, but offers full access to ETH rewards, and full control over the setup and security of your validator. Pooled staking has a significantly lower barrier to entry. Users can stake small amounts of ETH, are not required to generate validator keys, and have no hardware requirements beyond a standard internet connection. Liquidity tokens enable the ability to exit from staking before this is enabled at the protocol level. If you're interested in these features, pooled staking may be a good fit.",
  "page-staking-comparison-saas-solo": "Similarities include having your own validator keys without having to pool funds, but with SaaS you must trust a third-party, who may potentially act maliciously or become a target of attack or regulation themselves. If these trust assumptions or centralization risks concern you, the gold standard of self-sovereign staking is solo staking.",
  "page-staking-comparison-saas-pools": "These are similar in that you're generally relying on someone else to run the validator client, but unlike SaaS, pooled staking allows you to participate with smaller amounts of ETH. If you're looking to stake with less than 32 ETH, consider checking these out.",
  "page-staking-comparison-pools-solo": "Pooled staking has a significantly lower barrier to entry when compared to home staking, but comes with additional risk by delegating all node operations to a third-party, and with a fee. Home staking gives full sovereignty and control over the choices that go into choosing a staking setup. Stakers never have to hand over their keys, and they earn full rewards without any middlemen taking a cut.",
  "page-staking-comparison-pools-saas": "These are similar in that stakers do not run the validator software themselves, but unlike pooling options, SaaS requires a full 32 ETH deposit to activate a validator. Rewards accumulate to the staker, and usually involve a monthly fee or other stake to use the service. If you'd prefer your own validator keys and are looking to stake at least 32 ETH, using a SaaS provider may be a good option for you.",

  "page-staking-faq-1-answer": "A <em>validator</em> is a virtual entity that lives on Ethereum and participates in the consensus of the Ethereum protocol. Validators are represented by a balance, public key, and other properties. A <em>validator client</em> is the software that acts on behalf of the validator by holding and using its private key. A single validator client can hold many key pairs, controlling many validators.",
  "page-staking-faq-2-question": "Why do I need to have funds at stake?",
  "page-staking-faq-2-answer": "A validator has the ability to propose and attest to blocks for the network. To prevent dishonest behavior, users must have their funds at stake. This allows the protocol to penalize malicious actors. Staking is a means to keep you honest, as your actions will have financial consequences.",
  "page-staking-faq-3-question": "Can I buy 'Eth2'?",
  "page-staking-faq-3-answer-p1": "There is no 'Eth2' token native to the protocol, as the native token ether (ETH) did not change when Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake.",

  "page-staking-faq-4-answer-p1": "Yes. Staking has been live since December 1, 2020",
