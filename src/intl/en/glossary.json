  "zk-rollup-definition": "A <a href=\"/glossary/#rollups\">rollup of transactions that use <a href=\"/glossary/#validity-proof\">validity proofs</a> to offer increased <a href=\"/glossary/#layer-2\">layer 2</a> transaction throughput while using the security provided by Mainnet (layer 1). Although they can't handle complex transaction types, like <a href=\"/glossary/#optimistic-rollups\">optimistic rollups</a>, they don't have latency issues because transactions are provably valid when submitted. <a href=\"/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/\">More on zero-knowledge rollups</a>."
