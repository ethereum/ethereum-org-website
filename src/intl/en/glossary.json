These include: <br/><br/><ul><li>deposited: At least 32 ETH has been deposited to the <a href=\"/glossary/#deposit-contract\">deposit contract</a> by the validator</li><li>pending: the validator is in the activation queue waiting to be voted into the network by existing validators</li><li>active: currently attesting and proposing blocks</li><li>slashing: the validator has misbehaved and is being slashed</li><li>exiting: the validator has been flagged for exiting the network, either voluntarily or because they have been ejected.</li></ul>",
  "validity-proof-term": "Validity proof",
  "validity-proof-definition": "A security model for certain <a href=\"/glossary/#layer-2\">layer 2</a> solutions where, to increase speed, transactions are rolled up into batches and submitted to Ethereum in a single transaction. The transaction computation is done offchain and then supplied to the main chain with a proof of their validity. This method increases the amount of transactions possible while maintaining security. Some <a href=\"/glossary/#rollups\">rollups</a> use <a href=\"/glossary/#fraud-proof\">fraud proof</a>. <a href=\"/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/\">More on zero-knowledge rollups</a>.",

  "validium-definition": "An offchain solution that uses <a href=\"/glossary/#validity-proof\">validity proofs</a> to improve transaction throughput. Unlike <a href=\"/glossary/#zk-rollup\">Zero-knowledge rollups</a>, validium data isn't stored on layer 1 Mainnet. <a href=\"/developers/docs/scaling/validium/\">More on validium</a>.",
  "vyper-term": "Vyper",
  "vyper-definition": "A high-level programming language with Python-like syntax. Intended to get closer to a pure functional language. Created by Vitalik Buterin. <a href=\"/developers/docs/smart-contracts/languages/#vyper\">More on Vyper</a>.",

  "web2-definition": "Is the current internet, focused on user-generated content and social media that are controlled by few companies. Web3 is a crypto belief that users should control their data and transactions instead.",
  "web3-term": "Web3",

  "zero-address-term": "Zero address",
  "zero-address-definition": "An Ethereum address, composed entirely of zeros, that is frequently used as an address to remove tokens from owned circulation. A distinction is drawn between tokens formally removed from a smart contract's index via the burn() method and those sent to this address.",
  "zk-proof-term": "Zero-knowledge proof",
  "zk-proof-definition": "A zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic method that allows an individual to prove that a statement is true without conveying any additional information. <a href=\"/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/\">More on zero-knowledge rollups</a>.",

  "zk-rollup-definition": "A <a href=\"/glossary/#rollups\">rollup</a> of transactions that use <a href=\"/glossary/#validity-proof\">validity proofs</a> to offer increased <a href=\"/glossary/#layer-2\">layer 2</a> transaction throughput while using the security provided by Mainnet (layer 1). Although they can't handle complex transaction types, like <a href=\"/glossary/#optimistic-rollup\">optimistic rollups</a>, they don't have latency issues because transactions are provably valid when submitted. <a href=\"/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/\">More on zero-knowledge rollups</a>."
