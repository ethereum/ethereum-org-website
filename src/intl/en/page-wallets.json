It is how you send and receive crypto, log into apps, and prove ownership of your account\u2014without needing an email or password.</p><p>Wallets manage your account\u2019s two cryptographic keys: a public key for receiving assets and identifying your account, and a private key that acts like a password to approve transactions.</p>",
  "page-wallets-faq-2-question": "Do I need a wallet to use Ethereum?",
  "page-wallets-faq-2-answer": "<p>Yes. A wallet is your gateway to Ethereum. Without one, you cannot hold ETH, use apps, send and receive assets, or manage digital items and NFTs.</p><p>Most Ethereum apps require you to connect a wallet\u2014just like traditional apps need you to create an account before you can use them.</p>",
  "page-wallets-faq-3-question": "What happens if I lose my wallet or recovery phrase?",
  "page-wallets-faq-3-answer": "<p>If you lose access to your wallet app (for example, if you lose your phone), you can restore your account and funds in a different wallet app using your backed-up recovery phrase.</p><p>If you lose your recovery phrase, there is no way to recover your account\u2014your funds become permanently inaccessible. That is why backing it up securely is critical.</p><p>Ethereum\u2019s Pectra upgrade (EIP-7702) introduced programmable wallet recovery so you can designate another wallet as a guardian. Many wallet apps are still rolling out these features\u2014learn more about social recovery in Vitalik Buterin\u2019s post.</p>",

  "page-wallets-faq-4-answer": "<p>Write down your recovery phrase and store it somewhere private, safe, and offline\u2014consider keeping two copies in different secure locations.</p><p>Never screenshot or share it. Avoid suspicious links and double-check every transaction before you sign.</p>",
  "page-wallets-faq-5-question": "Can apps steal my crypto if I connect my wallet?",
  "page-wallets-faq-5-answer": "<p>No. Connecting your wallet does not give an app access to your funds\u2014you still have to approve every transaction with your private key.</p><p>After you connect, only approve transactions you trust. Make sure you are on the legitimate app site, not a phishing clone, and verify all details before signing.</p>",
