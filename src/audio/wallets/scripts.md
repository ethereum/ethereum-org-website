What are crypto wallets and why do you need one?

Wallets are applications that give you control over your Ethereum account. Just like your physical wallet, it contains everything you need to prove your identity and handle your assets. Your wallet allows you to sign into applications, read your balance, send transactions and verify your identity.

Its important to know that wallet app providers don't have custody of your funds. They just provide you a window to see your assets on Ethereum and tools to easily manage them. 

That means you can swap wallet providers at any time and keep the same account. Many wallets also let you manage several different accounts from one application.

To sum up what wallet is:

An app for managing your funds
Your wallet shows your balances, transaction history and gives you a way to send/receive funds. Some wallets may offer more.

Your Ethereum account
Your wallet is your window into your Ethereum account â€“ your balance, transaction history and more. But you can swap wallet providers at any time.

Your login for Ethereum apps
Your wallet lets you connect to applications using your Ethereum account. It's like a login you can use across many apps.


Now, let's clarify some important terms that often get mixed up.

An Ethereum account is like your digital identity, made up of two important keys. A public key, which creates your address that you can share with others, and a private key, which must be kept secret as it's used to sign transactions. Think of these keys working together to help you manage your digital assets and make transactions.

Your public key, also known as your Ethereum address works just like an email address - it's the public identifier for your digital assets.
You can freely share this public address with others when you want to receive funds or interact with blockchain applications. Make sure you do not share your private key with anyone else though.

There are several types of wallets you can choose from. Hardware wallets are physical devices that keep your crypto offline for maximum security. Mobile wallets are applications that let you access your funds on your phone. Browser wallets are web applications for managing your account. Browser extensions are extensions that connect you to Ethereum through your web browser. Lastly, Desktop applications are programs for managing funds on your computer in a standalone application.

It's important to reiterate: Your wallet doesn't actually hold your funds. Your wallet simply provides a window to view and manage your account on the Ethereum network. This also means that you can change which wallet you use at any time.

In the world of cryptocurrency, you are your own bank. This means you're responsible for keeping your keys safe and secure. Never share your recovery phrase, also called a seed phrase, with anyone. Always write it down physically and store it in a safe place. And remember - triple check everything before making transactions, as they cannot be reversed. With great financial freedom comes great responsibility.
