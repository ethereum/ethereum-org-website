    "description": "Runtime Verification is a leading formal verification company specializing in blockchain security and smart contract correctness. We've developed ERCx, the most comprehensive open-source testing library for ERC token standards, featuring over 500 individual tests across ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-4626 implementations.\nERCx directly empowers Superchain builders by providing production-ready test suites that verify both standard compliance and security properties. Our library offers zero-configuration testing for deployed contracts via Foundry fork testing, plus simple integration for pre-deployment source code validation. With three testing tiers: Standard (EIP compliance), Security (vulnerability detection), and Features (implementation validation), developers can ship token contracts with confidence, knowing they've been thoroughly vetted against real-world attack vectors and edge cases.\nWhat makes ERCx particularly valuable for the Optimism ecosystem is its cross-chain compatibility and handling of complex deployment scenarios. The library seamlessly works across OP Stack chains and handles storage complexities that often challenge developers working with established tokens like USDC or stETH. By providing this critical testing infrastructure as open-source tooling, we're enabling safer, more reliable token implementations across the entire Superchain, directly supporting the ecosystem's growth while reducing the security risks that have historically plagued token contracts in DeFi.",

    "description": "Debugging deployed smart contracts today relies on guesswork. No EVM-language compiler emits enough structured debug data. As a result, debuggers must reverse-engineer arcane details of high-level language internals—a brittle, inaccurate, and hard-to-maintain process. This slows development, impedes audits, and obscures contract behavior.\n\nThe ethdebug format is a proposed standard for debugging metadata. It’s language-agnostic, tool-friendly, and designed to map EVM execution back to source locations, control flow, data structures, and developer intent. The goal is to enable reliable debugging of deployed contracts—without requiring compiler internals or custom builds.\n\nThe format is still in development. Implementations are currently underway in solc and in multiple existing debuggers. The focus is on interoperability, minimal overhead, and incremental adoption.\n\nethdebug is part of the Argot Collective, a new organization spinning out from the Ethereum Foundation. Argot's other projects include Act, hevm, Fe, Sourcify, and Solidity.\n\nThis work directly supports Optimism’s mission to fund shared public infrastructure. A common debugging standard makes smart contracts easier to understand, audit, and build on—across chains, languages, and tools.",

    "description": "IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer protocol designed to make the web faster, more open, and more resilient. By using content-addressed storage rather than location-based references, IPFS removes the need for centralized servers and allows files to be distributed and retrieved from multiple nodes around the world. This approach lowers hosting costs, improves data availability, and reduces censorship, laying the groundwork for a more secure and permanent global information network.\n\nIPFS is used in a variety of applications. While some users interact with IPFS via imported libraries in their projects, a large amount of usage comes via IPFS' HTTP Gateway API which allows users to self-host, use extensions like IPFS companion, or publicly run gateways (whether paid ones run by companies like Filebase, Pinata, etc. or the public goods services at ipfs.io and dweb.link).\n\nIPFS is a system for moving data across decentralized networks, with >11M weekly users and 250K public p2p nodes. Highlights:\n\n1. Off-chain storage. IPFS provides verifiable, off-chain storage, often used to reduce on-chain needs in Ethereum & Optimism. Examples: TrueBlocks (local IPFS-based index for EVM chains, built with grants from OP & EF), Snapshot (IPFS-based off-chain voting).\n\n2. Go-to distribution network for fully decentralized third-party app frontends (for gaming, DeFi, & more). We run gateway services that serve 900M requests/wk, and added native IPFS support to browsers like Chromium & Brave.\n\n3. NFT metadata gold standard. Over 115M NFTs are stored on IPFS, including leading platforms OpenSea (which supports Optimism NFTs), Rarible, and Zora.",

    "description": "The Ethernaut is a community-driven capture-the-flag wargame that challenges developers of all levels to break smart contracts while learning common Solidity vulnerabilities. Maintained by OpenZeppelin, each level provides a gamified experience where a smart contract must be ‘hacked’ to progress. It is 100% open-source, with all levels contributed by players.\n\nIn 2024, we have continued expanding the game, adding four new advanced levels—HigherOrder, Stake, Impersonator, and Magic Animal Carousel—which explore current vulnerabilities in smart contract development. These levels introduce challenges related to low-level EVM programming, staking vulnerabilities, signature verification exploits, and bitwise manipulation attacks, pushing players to deepen their understanding of Ethereum security.\n\nBeyond new levels, we have also redesigned the UI, added support for multiple networks, and expanded language translations to make the game more accessible to a global audience.\n\nWe believe that The Ethernaut is an essential training tool for developers across the Ethereum ecosystem, including those building on the Optimism network. By continually evolving the game with new challenges and features, we strive to make smart contract security education engaging, practical, and accessible to everyone.",

    "description": "What is it?\nMoccasin is an open source, public-good developer tool. It's a python-based Vyper smart contract development, deployment, and testing framework.\n\nWhy is it needed?\nThe Web3 Python ecosystem has been overshadowed by the Rust and Javascript ecosystems, which is a crucial misstep when all financial and AI developers use Python. Walk into any asset manager or hedge fund and ask the portfolio managers or traders what they are using, and the answer is Python. We need a fast and modern tool for Python exploration. \n\nVyper adds to smart contract language diversity, which is as important as having client diversity from the blockchain infrastructure. If one has a critical bug, we minimize the downside by having different languages.\n\nHow is it unique?\nMoccasin is the fastest Python framework and, for Vyper smart contracts, even outpaces Foundry in some instances. It achieves this speed by being built on the lightning-fast Titanoboa tool.\n\nYou can see a quick benchmark of compile time for Vyper contracts across popular frameworks like Apeworx and Foundry.\nhttps://github.com/Cyfrin/Moccasin/blob/main/docs/source/_static/stats-default.png?raw=true\n\nWhat can it do?\nEncrypt keys\nRun tests\nUnderstand deployment contexts\nAnd ideally work with the growing number of non-EVM compatible chains (ie, ZKsync, Scroll, etc)\nRun fuzzing campaigns\n\nMoccasin is a new tool, but due to its speed and developer friendliness, we expect to see its adoption skyrocket in the Python community.\nWhat really sets Moccasin apart, other than being the fastest and most developer-friendly Python tooling for Viper, is that developers can now script and perform DevOps in the user-friendly language Python.\n\nWhat is our roadmap?\nYou can see a list of 0.4.0 roadmap items (and other priority items) for Moccasin including:\nbetter multi-sig & hardware wallet integration\nin-line debugger\nSolidity support\nMedusa fuzzing\nbuillt-in halmos or HEVM support\n\nWho is it for?\nPython developers. According to the Stack Overflow 2024 survey, python is the #1 programming language for new developers.\nSo, Moccasin is for new developers.\nAccording to Upwork, Python is the #1 language for people working in AI.\nSo, Moccasin is for AI developers.\nAccording to Columbia Engineering, python is the #1 language for fintech.\nSo, Moccasin is for financial developers, including DeFi.\nThis tool is meant for both new and advanced developers - a tool that is easy to pick up and powerful enough for professional applications. (edited) \n\nWith this tool, we want to start bridging the gap between web2 and web3 developers and encourage builders to move into our industry. Allowing developers to use multiple languages and to grow the adoption of the Sueprchain.  \n",

It's still, the same team at Web3 Labs responsible for maintaining and supporting the library for its wide and varied user base. The Hyperledger association is great for visibility, but doesn't provide any funding for the project!\n\nWe rely on grant funding to sustain this library and hopeful to qualify for this RPGF round.\n\nUnfortunately, we missed out on OP RPGF 3 as we had not realised projects were eligible for multiple rounds so did not apply following our success in OP RPGF 2.\n\n🙏🏻",

    "description": "Rundler (Rust Bundler) is an ERC-4337 bundler implementation written in Rust. Rundler is designed to achieve high-performance and high-reliability in cloud deployments via a modular architecture. Currently, both Alchemy and Coinbase’s Base team use Rundler. It powers >70% of UOs in the Ethereum ecosystem and a vast majority of UOs in the Superchain. Rundler is OSS licensed with GPL.\n\nRundler powers the ERC-4337 ecosystem with an implementation that users can rely on to scale reliably. Rundler open source code repo has 300+ stars, more than 50 forks. \n\nOur goals with Rundler:\n\nERC-4337 Specification Compliance: Rundler strives to implement the full ERC-4337 specification and to maintain support as the specification changes and new onchain components are released. This includes new Entry Point contract support, support for the upcoming P2P mempool specification, support for alternative mempools, and more.\nBest-in-class Performance and Reliability: Rundler strives to power the most demanding workloads in cloud environments. Rust was chosen for its high performance and memory safety. Rundler's modular architecture lets providers choose to run the stateless components (RPC, builder) in a fully horizontally scalable manner connecting to the stateful components (mempool, p2p, event cache) via the network. Rundler's bundle builder is designed to be able to support the full gas throughput of the network it's building for.\nExtensibility/Chain Support: ERC-4337 is designed to support any EVM chain. However, different EVM supporting networks have different rules around how to support things like gas usage, gas fees, precompiles, etc. Rundler is designed to be extensible and easily adapted to support any EVM chain.\nModularity: Rundler is written in a modular manner, allowing its components to be run as a single integrated binary, or as a distributed system. Rundler also strives for its individual crates to be used to support future ERC-4337 tooling.\n\nIn RPGF Round 3, Alchemy was awarded a total of 74,534 $OP across Rundler, Light Account, ERC-6900, aa-sdk, and various informational pieces put out to the public domain to further adoption of smart accounts in the Superchain.",

Its strength lies in its flexibility and high customization, catering to the diverse needs of its users.

Unlike the original Snapshot, Snapshot X operates fully onchain using a set of modular smart contracts. This shift makes Snapshot censorship resistant, with onchain and cross-chain voting power computation and trustless execution, while keeping gas costs to the minimal extent possible.",

    "description": "The OP Token Historical Balance is a critical tool developed by WakeUp Labs that improves the usability and functionality of the Optimism blockchain. This service empowers developers, analysts, and users by enabling them to query historical blockchain data at any specific moment in time. It supports queries for any public view function of smart contracts deployed on Optimism, from the very first block to the present. By providing access to historical state data, this project directly supports transparency, research, and analytics, which are crucial for the evolution and understanding of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nOur project contributes to the OP Stack Tooling category by providing a fundamental utility that facilitates better decision-making, auditing, and research within the Optimism network. This tool is vital for developers who require accurate historical data to test, validate, and optimize their applications. Additionally, it promotes the growth of the Optimism ecosystem by reducing barriers to entry and fostering a more robust environment for innovation.\n\nWakeUp Labs is dedicated to advancing the capabilities of Ethereum's Layer 2 solutions, and we believe that tools like the OP Token Historical Balance are essential for driving adoption and enhancing the overall developer experience. By making Optimism's blockchain data more accessible and usable, we aim to empower the community and fuel the next wave of development on the OP Stack.",

    "description": "We have developed a signer proxy software that enables the OP Stack chain to use an external signer (currently supporting AWS KMS and YubiHSM) through the official signer client to signer the sequencer, batcher, proposer and challenger transactions. However, the official signer client does not integrate with external signers, so we have implemented this functionality in our signer proxy.\n\nCurrently, the process outlined in the Optimism documentation for setting up a sequencer, batcher, and proposer requires using plain private keys, creating an insecure environment for mainnet deployment. Although the documentation suggests using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management, it lacks detailed guidance beyond referencing source code. Chain operators, particularly those using bare metal setups, often prefer YubiHSM2 over cloud-based solutions like AWS KMS due to its hardware-native security.\n\nTo enhance security, mainnet chain operators are encouraged to use industry-standard hardware signers like YubiHSM2 or AWS KMS. This approach allows operators to deploy Optimism stack chains securely by protecting private keys with hardware-based solutions. Existing resources, such as the integration of YubiHSM2 into the Keplr wallet and the TMKMS YubiHSM installer, provide relevant experiences that support this approach.\n\nOur AWS KMS Signer proxy has been used by the Lisk team for their op-challenger. We are working with them to make signer proxy perfect and production ready.",

    "name": "Aderyn",
    "description": "Aderyn is an open-source, public-good developer tool. It is a Rust-based solidity smart contract static analyzer designed to help protocol engineers and security researchers find vulnerabilities in Solidity code bases.\n\nAderyn integrates seamlessly into small and enterprise-level development workflows. It offers lightning-fast, command-line static analysis functionality and a framework for building custom detectors that adapt to any Solidity codebase.\n\nAderyn does three things really well:‍‍‍\nIdentify Solidity Smart contract vulnerabilities: Cyfrin Aderyn quickly identifies potential vulnerabilities in Solidity code and highlights parts of the codebase for further investigation.\n\nSupports building custom detectors to suit your needs: Protocols and security researchers can use the Cyfrin Aderyn framework to build custom vulnerability detectors for any Solidity codebase.\n\nIdentify known issues and protect OP value: Competitive auditing platforms can use Cyfrin Aderyn to detect and filter out known issues inside protocol codebases, protecting customers' and auditors' time and value.\n\nWho is it for?\n\n1. Developers\nAs a new generation of developers enters the space, we (the security community) are responsible for using our knowledge and experience to create tools that facilitate secure development practices. We need to make it easy to avoid repeating past mistakes.\n\nFrom a developer's perspective, the cost of finding bugs in Solidity code is exorbitantly high. Engaging top-tier security firms like Cyfrin Private Audits or competitive audit platforms like CodeHawks requires serious cash. That's because the security knowledge required to stamp out bugs is pooled among security firms and competitive auditors, who are in demand.\n\nWe must drive the cost of finding bugs, especially the common and known ones, towards zero by creating tools that make development secure by nature.\n\nAderyn is built for lightning-fast, open-source static analysis that hooks into the existing development workflow.\n\n2. Security Researchers\nSecurity Researchers are the knowledge guardians of the on-chain world. They are the people you engage with when you're undergoing an audit. Many auditors start every audit with a long checklist. They read through the codebase, ensuring the code doesn't violate any items on their list. If it does, it's an issue for the report. Once they've finished with this list, they get creative and try out other techniques.\n\nAderyn's detector framework enables Security Researchers to encode the patterns they look for in their checklist into Aderyn detectors. By doing this, the research community can focus on the deeper, more complex bugs, knowing that tooling has uncovered the repetitive checklist of issues so they don't have to.\n\nDevelopers write more secure code before they engage Security Researchers, and when they do, the Researchers can spend more time on complex bugs instead of manually checking for easy fixes.\n\nWhat makes Aderyn unique vs similar tools?\nSpeed: Real-time feedback as you’re coding with the upcoming vscode extension.\n\nCutting-edge detectors: The detectors are built from the latest findings from external and in-house auditors. This means developers can harness the power of an audit team at their fingertips for free!\n\n“Auditor Mode”: Helps auditors find specific areas and concepts within a codebase to dig further. For example, “Show me all of the instances in which this storage slot is altered”.\n\nOpen-source: This tool is completely open-source and will be free for all developers in perpetuity. Cyfrin does not make money directly from it.\n\nAdoption of tool: Aderyn is now used by developers across the Superchain ecosystem and we are continuously building new custom detectors for developers. \n\nImportance of tool: Security is paramount for mass adoption. Without security, adding any TVL to the Superchain is risky. We want to support developers from day zero and provide real time security analysis whilst projects are being built.\n\nSuperchain interoperability: We want to ensure that when working cross chain, builders are doing so with secure frameworks. We also include building customer detectors for interoperability. \n\nWho are Cyfrin:\nCyfrin is the industry-leading smart contract education and security company. Home to 8,000 security researchers and a community of over 100,000 students and smart contract engineers, we provide audits, tools, and education to the world's biggest decentralized protocols, institutions, and products.\n\nCyfrin works closely with Optimism and the Superchain as a whitelisted security service provider. We want to continue adding value to the Optimims ecosystem. \n\nThis project refers specifically to Cyfrin's developer tool, Aderyn.",

    "description": "Runtime Verification has been at the forefront of open-source formal verification tools for more than a decade. Our generalistic approach allows us to use our technology on multiple blockchains. While KEVM offers our verification infrastructure to all EVM-based smart contracts, Kontrol greatly reduces the barrier to entry to formal verification for Solidity smart contracts.\nOur tooling is completely open source and freely accessible to all developers of the Optimism ecosystem at no additional cost.\n\nKEVM is an EVM executable formal semantics written in the K framework. KEVM passes all Ethereum conformance tests and is the entry point for formally verifying smart contracts with the K framework. However, using plain KEVM requires ad-hoc training on the K framework to write specifications. Additionally, these specifications can be quite verbose, increasing the difficulty of writing them.\n\nKontrol solves this by allowing developers to write the formal specification of their smart contracts directly as Foundry property tests. These tests are automatically translated into KEVM specifications, keeping all the verification guarantees whilst allowing for a much more easy developer experience.",

Such tools include SMT solvers (cvc5, z3, bitwuzla), theorem provers (Coq) and economic analysis tooling (CheckMate, Open Games). Act specifications can be automatically proved equivalent to concrete implementations in EVM. For very simple contracts, Act specifications can be automatically generated from EVM bytecode.\n\nThis is an end-to-end pipeline that supports principled reasoning about high level properties of EVM bytecode. It supports reasoning about both correctness (e.g. accounting invariants) and economic properties (e.g. incentive compatibility). Act specifications serve as a high-level smart contract representation, allowing for easy integration of existing general purpose analysis and verification tooling into the EVM context.",

    "description": "Bonadocs allows web3 engineering teams to collaborate and build applications in a very intuitive way. To simplify integrations, we've categorized our tooling as follows:\n\nDocgen: Docgen allows developers to go from their codebase to beautiful and interactive documentation in seconds. Using our hardhat plugin, you can generate interactive documentation to query your contract methods.\n\nWidget: Through our playground environment, you can generate widgets for your contract methods. These widgets can then be easily embedded in your docs or any react application for devs to query. This is instrumental for devrel teams, to help onboard external devs.\n\nPlayground: Our playground is a collaborative environment primarily for solidity and front-end devs to build applications. This can be used by internal engineering teams or teams across different organizations. Devrel teams can also take advantage of the playground to create a single source of truth for their protocol - making onboarding super easy for their developer community.\n\nProtocol Registry: Our protocol registry is an open-source tool that allows you to find different popular protocols and their respective playgrounds.\n\nOn a high level, bonadocs are created to simplify the documentation, interaction, and integration of smart contracts - similar to Postman and web APIs.\n\nTry it out: https://docs.bonadocs.com/\nPlayground demo: https://x.com/thisdavidboy/status/1854809292836339939",

    "name": "OP ENS Gateway by Opti.Domains",
    "description": "Opti.Domains has developed an ENS Gateway implementation for OP Stack chains that supports various proofs, including those from L2OutputOracle, Dispute Game, and Anchor State. The appropriate proof is automatically selected based on the configuration of the OP Stack chain.\n\nThe Opti.Domains ENS Gateway automatically upgrades in response to the OP Stack's transition from L2OutputOracle to Dispute Game, requiring no manual intervention or updates to the verifier contract or gateway server.\n\nThe ENS Gateway, specifically the EVMGateway, enables trustless cross-chain data retrieval for ENS names deployed on Layer 2 networks like Optimism with a CCIP Gateway. When an ENS name lookup occurs, the resolver reverts with OffchainLookup containing the gateway URL. The client then contacts the gateway, which returns the requested data. This data is passed to a callback function on the resolver for verification before being returned to the client as the final result of the name lookup.\n\nOur ENS Gateway has a mechanism to ensure liveliness even in the event that the respected dispute game type has suddenly changed, as seen in the recent proposal, 'Upgrade Proposal #10: Granite Network Upgrade,' by storing a backup dispute game type and only trusting its anchor state.\n\nOpti.Domains has also developed social verification and attestation to EAS in collaboration with Bored Town. We are on our way to scaling ENS to OP. We have contributed to the ENS OP Gateway development, which is currently under review by ENS core developers.\n\nThe Namespace team has expressed interest and reached out to us with questions about using our OP ENS Gateway. Additionally, several teams have participated in discussions regarding the development of our OP ENS Gateway.",
