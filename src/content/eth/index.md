## What is ETH, and how do I get it? {#what-is-eth-and-how-do-i-get-it}

Ether, or ETH, is Ethereum's native currency. It is "digital money" that can be sent over the internet instantly and cheaply, and also be used in many [Ethereum-based applications](/en/dapps/).

The easiest way to get ETH is to buy some from an exchange or [wallet](/en/wallets/). Availability differs from country to country so check where you can buy ETH based on where you live first.
