This tutorial is Part 3/3 in the NFT Tutorial series, where we view our newly minted NFT. However, you can use the general tutorial for any ERC-721 token using MetaMask, including on Mainnet or any testnet. If you’d like to learn how to mint your own NFT on Ethereum, you should check out [Part 1 on How to Write & Deploy an NFT smart contract](/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft)!

Congrats! You’ve made it to the shortest and simplest part of our NFT tutorial series — how to view your freshly minted NFT on a virtual wallet. We’ll be using MetaMask for this example since it is what we used in the previous two parts.

As a prerequisite, you should already have MetaMask on mobile installed, and it should include the account to which you minted your NFT — you can get the app for free on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask-blockchain-wallet/id1438144202) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask&hl=en_US&gl=US).

## Step 1: Set your network to Ropsten {#set-network-to-ropsten}

At the top of the app, press the “Wallet” button, after which you’ll be prompted to select a network. As our NFT was minted on the Ropsten network, you’ll want to select Ropsten as your network.

## Step 2: Add your collectable to MetaMask {#add-nft-to-metamask}

Once you’re on the Ropsten network, select the “Collectibles” tab on the right and add the NFT smart contract address and the ERC-721 token ID of your NFT — which you should be able to find on Etherscan based on the transaction hash from your NFT deployed in Part II of our tutorial.

You may need to refresh a couple times to view your NFT — but it will be there <Emoji text="😄" size={1} />!

Congrats! You have successfully minted an NFT, and you can now view it! We can’t wait to see how you’ll take the NFT world by storm!
