This documentation is designed to help you build with Ethereum. It covers Ethereum as a concept, explains the Ethereum tech stack, and documents advanced topics for more complex applications and use cases.

This is an open-source community effort, so feel free to suggest new topics, add new content, and provide examples wherever you think it might be helpful. All documentation is editable via GitHub – if you're unsure how, [follow these instructions](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/blob/dev/README.md).

## Development modules {#development-modules}

If this is your first attempt at Ethereum development, we recommend starting at the beginning and working your way through like a book.

### Fundamental topics {#fundamental-topics}

- [Intro to Ethereum](/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/) _– A quick overview of Ethereum_
- [Intro to Ether](/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/) _– A quick overview of Ether_
- [Web2 vs Web3](/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/) _– The fundamental differences that blockchain-based applications provide_
- [Intro to dapps](/developers/docs/dapps/) _– An introduction to decentralized applications_
- [The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](/developers/docs/evm/) _– The EVM handles all the computation on the Ethereum network_
- [Blocks](/developers/docs/blocks/) _– The way transactions are batched to ensure state is synchronised across all actors_
- [Accounts](/developers/docs/accounts/) _– Entities in the network that can hold a balance and send transactions_
- [Transactions](/developers/docs/transactions/) _– Transfers and other actions that cause Ethereum's state to change_
- [Block explorers](/developers/docs/data-and-analytics/block-explorers/) _– A way to read data about transactions, accounts, blocks and the network_
- [Gas](/developers/docs/gas/) _– Computational power required to process transactions, paid for in ETH by transaction senders_
- [Mining](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/mining/) _– The way transactions are processed and blocks are created_
- [Networks](/developers/docs/networks/) _– Implementations of Ethereum including test networks_
- [Nodes and clients](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) _– The individuals participating in the network and the software they run to verify transactions_

### The Ethereum stack {#the-ethereum-stack}

- [Intro to the stack](/developers/docs/ethereum-stack/) _– An overview of the Ethereum/web3 stack_
- [Smart contracts](/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) _– Programs that reside at an Ethereum address and run functions when triggered by transactions_
- [Programming languages](/developers/docs/programming-languages/) _– How to get started with Ethereum using languages you may already know_
- [Javascript client libraries](/developers/docs/apis/javascript/) _– Convenience libraries that allow your web app to interact with Ethereum and smart contracts_
- [Security](/developers/docs/security/)
- [Storage](/developers/docs/storage/)
- [Development frameworks](/developers/docs/frameworks/) _– Tools that makes developing with Ethereum easier_
- [Development environments](/developers/docs/ides/) _– The best environments to write dapp code_
