Learn how to develop for Ethereum using the Delphi programming language

</div>

Use Ethereum to create decentralized applications (or "dapps") that utilize the benefits of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. These dapps can be trustworthy, meaning that once they are deployed to Ethereum, they will always run as programmed. They can control digital assets in order to create new kinds of financial applications. They can be decentralized, meaning that no single entity or person controls them and are nearly impossible to censor.

Build decentralized applications on top of Ethereum and interact with smart contracts using the Delphi programming language!

## Getting started with smart contracts and the Solidity language {#getting-started-with-smart-contracts-and-the-solidity-language}
