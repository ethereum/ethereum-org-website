Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. The simplest transaction is transferring ETH from one account to another.

<!-- TODO explain these 2 types of transactions -->
<!-- There are two types of transactions: those which result in message calls and those which result in contract creation. -->
<!-- Contract creation results in the creation of a new contract account containing compiled smart contract bytecode. Whenever another account makes a message call to that contract, it executes its bytecode. -->

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To help you better understand this page, we recommend you first read [Accounts](/developers/docs/accounts/) and our [introduction to Ethereum](/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/).

## What's a transaction? {#whats-a-transaction}

An Ethereum transaction refers to an action initiated by an externally-owned account, in other words an account managed by a human, not a contract. For example, if Bob sends Alice 1 ETH, Bob's account must be debited and Alice's must be credited. This state-changing action takes place within a transaction.

Transactions, which change the state of the EVM, need to be broadcast to the whole network. Any node can broadcast a request for a transaction to be executed on the EVM; after this happens, a miner will execute the transaction and propagate the resulting state change to the rest of the network.

Transactions require a fee and must be mined to become valid. To make this overview simpler we'll cover gas fees and mining elsewhere.

A submitted transaction includes the following information:

- `recipient` – the receiving address (if an externally-owned account, the transaction will transfer value. If a contract account, the transaction will execute the contract code)
- `signature` – the identifier of the sender. This is generated when the sender's private key signs the transaction and confirms the sender has authorised this transaction
- `value` – amount of ETH to transfer from sender to recipient (in WEI, a denomination of ETH)
- `data` – optional field to include arbitrary data
- `gasLimit` – the maximum amount of gas units that can be consumed by the transaction. Units of gas represent computational steps
- `maxPriorityFeePerGas` - the maximum amount of gas to be included as a tip to the miner
- `maxFeePerGas` - the maximum amount of gas willing to be paid for the transaction (inclusive of `baseFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas`)

Gas is a reference to the computation required to process the transaction by a miner. Users have to pay a fee for this computation. The `gasLimit`, and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` determine the maximum transaction fee paid to the miner. [More on Gas](/developers/docs/gas/).

The transaction object will look a little like this:

```js
{
  from: "0xEA674fdDe714fd979de3EdF0F56AA9716B898ec8",
  to: "0xac03bb73b6a9e108530aff4df5077c2b3d481e5a",
  gasLimit: "21000",
  maxFeePerGas: "300"
  maxPriorityFeePerGas: "10"
  nonce: "0",
  value: "10000000000",
}
```

But a transaction object needs to be signed using the sender's private key. This proves that the transaction could only have come from the sender and was not sent fraudulently.

An Ethereum client like Geth will handle this signing process.

Example [JSON-RPC](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API) call:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "account_signTransaction",
  "params": [
    {
      "from": "0x1923f626bb8dc025849e00f99c25fe2b2f7fb0db",
      "gas": "0x55555",
      "maxFeePerGas": "0x1234",
      "maxPriorityFeePerGas": "0x1234",
      "input": "0xabcd",
      "nonce": "0x0",
      "to": "0x07a565b7ed7d7a678680a4c162885bedbb695fe0",
      "value": "0x1234"
    }
  ]
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "raw": "0xf88380018203339407a565b7ed7d7a678680a4c162885bedbb695fe080a44401a6e4000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001226a0223a7c9bcf5531c99be5ea7082183816eb20cfe0bbc322e97cc5c7f71ab8b20ea02aadee6b34b45bb15bc42d9c09de4a6754e7000908da72d48cc7704971491663",
    "tx": {
      "nonce": "0x0",
      "maxFeePerGas": "0x1234",
      "maxPriorityFeePerGas": "0x1234",
      "gas": "0x55555",
      "to": "0x07a565b7ed7d7a678680a4c162885bedbb695fe0",
      "value": "0x1234",
      "input": "0xabcd",
      "v": "0x26",
      "r": "0x223a7c9bcf5531c99be5ea7082183816eb20cfe0bbc322e97cc5c7f71ab8b20e",
      "s": "0x2aadee6b34b45bb15bc42d9c09de4a6754e7000908da72d48cc7704971491663",
      "hash": "0xeba2df809e7a612a0a0d444ccfa5c839624bdc00dd29e3340d46df3870f8a30e"
    }
  }
}
```

- the `raw` is the signed transaction in Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoded form
- the `tx` is the signed transaction in JSON form

With the signature hash, the transaction can be cryptographically proven that it came from the sender and submitted to the network.

## Types of transactions {#types-of-transactions}

On Ethereum there are a few different types of transactions:
 
- Regular transactions: a transaction from one wallet to another.
- Contract deployment transactions: a transaction without a 'to' address, where the data field is used for the contract code.

### On gas {#on-gas}

As mentioned, transactions cost [gas](/developers/docs/gas/) to execute. Simple transfer transactions require 21000 units of Gas.

So for Bob to send Alice 1 ETH at a `baseFeePerGas` of 190 gwei and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` of 10 gwei, Bob will need to pay the following fee:

```
(190 + 10) * 21000 = 4,200,000 gwei
--or--
0.0042 ETH
```

Bob's account will be debited **-1.0042 ETH**

Alice's account will be credited **+1.0 ETH**

The base fee will be burned **-0.003735 ETH**

Miner keeps the tip **+0.000197 ETH**

Gas is required for any smart contract interaction too.

![Diagram showing how unused gas is refunded](./gas-tx.png)
_Diagram adapted from [Ethereum EVM illustrated](https://takenobu-hs.github.io/downloads/ethereum_evm_illustrated.pdf)_

Any gas not used in a transaction is refunded to the user account.

## Transaction lifecycle {#transaction-lifecycle}

Once the transaction has been submitted the following happens:

1. Once you send a transaction, cryptography generates a transaction hash:
   `0x97d99bc7729211111a21b12c933c949d4f31684f1d6954ff477d0477538ff017`
2. The transaction is then broadcast to the network and included in a pool with lots of other transactions.
3. A miner must pick your transaction and include it in a block in order to verify the transaction and consider it "successful".
   - You may end up waiting at this stage if the network is busy and miners aren't able to keep up.
4. Your transaction will also get a block confirmation number. This is the number of blocks created since the block that your transaction was included in. The higher the number, the greater the certainty that the transaction was processed and recognised by the network. This is because sometimes the block your transaction was included in may not have made it into the chain.
   - The larger the block confirmation number the more immutable the transaction is. So for higher value transactions, more block confirmations may be desired.

<!-- **State change**

FROM THE WHITEPAPER:

1. Check if the transaction is well-formed (ie. has the right number of values), the signature is valid, and the nonce matches the nonce in the sender's account. If not, return an error.
2. Calculate the transaction fee as `STARTGAS * GASPRICE`, and determine the sending address from the signature. Subtract the fee from the sender's account balance and increment the sender's nonce. If there is not enough balance to spend, return an error.
3. Initialize `GAS = STARTGAS`, and take off a certain quantity of gas per byte to pay for the bytes in the transaction.
4. Transfer the transaction value from the sender's account to the receiving account. If the receiving account does not yet exist, create it. If the receiving account is a contract, run the contract's code either to completion or until the execution runs out of gas.
5. If the value transfer failed because the sender did not have enough money, or the code execution ran out of gas, revert all state changes except the payment of the fees, and add the fees to the miner's account.
6. Otherwise, refund the fees for all remaining gas to the sender, and send the fees paid for gas consumed to the miner.

<!-- ## Failed transactions

A transaction can fail for a number of reasons:

- Not enough gas
  - The gas limit is too low
- Reverted -->

<!-- ## Messages

Messages are like transactions between contract accounts but they're not added to the blockchain. They allow smart contracts to call other contracts and trigger their execution.

FROM WHITEPAPER:

A message is produced when a contract currently executing code executes the `CALL` opcode, which produces and executes a message. Like a transaction, a message leads to the recipient account running its code. Thus, contracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the same way that external actors can.

@Sam Richards help me understand messages please :D

```
// FROM SOLIDITY DOCS
Contracts can call other contracts or send ether to non-contract accounts by the means of message calls. Message calls are similar to transactions, in that they have a source, a target, data payload, Ether, gas and return data. In fact, every transaction consists of a top-level message call which in turn can create further message calls.

A contract can decide how much of its remaining gas should be sent with the inner message call and how much it wants to retain. If an out-of-gas exception happens in the inner call (or any other exception), this will be signalled by an error value put onto the stack. In this case, only the gas sent together with the call is used up. In Solidity, the calling contract causes a manual exception by default in such situations, so that exceptions “bubble up” the call stack.

As already said, the called contract (which can be the same as the caller) will receive a freshly cleared instance of memory and has access to the call payload - which will be provided in a separate area called the calldata. After it has finished execution, it can return data which will be stored at a location in the caller’s memory preallocated by the caller.

Calls are limited to a depth of 1024, which means that for more complex operations, loops should be preferred over recursive calls.

let wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider)

let amount = ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0")

let tx = {

  // ... or supports ENS names
  // to: "ricmoo.firefly.eth",

  // We must pass in the amount as wei (1 ether = 1e18 wei), so we
  // use this convenience function to convert ether to wei.
  value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0"),
}

let sendPromise = wallet.sendTransaction(tx)

sendPromise.then((tx) => {
  console.log(tx)
