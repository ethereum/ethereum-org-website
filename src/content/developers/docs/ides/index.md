When it comes to setting up an [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), building with Ethereum is similar to any other software project. There's many options to choose from, so at the end of the day, pick the one that best suits your preferences.

## Web-based IDEs {#web-based-ides}

If you're looking to fiddle with code before you [set up a local development environment](/developers/local-environment/), these web apps are custom-built for Ethereum smart contract development.

**Remix -** **_Web-based IDE with built in static analysis, and a test blockchain virtual machine._**
