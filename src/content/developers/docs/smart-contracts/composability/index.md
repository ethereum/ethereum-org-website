## A brief introduction {#a-brief-introduction}

Smart contracts are public on Ethereum and can be thought of as open APIs. You don't need to write your own smart contract to become a dapp developer, you just need to know how to interact with them. For example, you can use the existing smart contracts of [Uniswap](https://uniswap.exchange/swap), a decentralized exchange, to handle all the token swap logic in your app – you don't need to start from scratch. [Check out some of their contracts](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-core/tree/main/contracts).
