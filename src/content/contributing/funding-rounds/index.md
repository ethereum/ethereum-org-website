# Contributor funding rounds {#contributor-funding-rounds}

The [ethereum.org website team](/about/), with sponsorship from the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation), is excited to be running a series of funding rounds to give back and reward community members who have made impactful contributions!

## What for? {#what-for}

Ethereum.org is currently managed by a core team of ten full-time individuals, but is comprised of contributions from **thousands of contributors** from all over the globe!

Contributions to ethereum.org have increased significantly in frequency over the past five years. While the vast majority of these contributions have been on a voluntary basis, large portions of the site content **would not have been possible** without this community support, and the core team has been investigating measures to return value to impactful contributors.

The goal is to retroactively reward impactful work, while encouraging and creating incentive for everyone to contribute to public goods, including ethereum.org. And of course, to say <strong>thank you</strong>.

## The challenge in deciding {#the-challenge-in-deciding}

Deciding _which_ contributions are deserving of financial reward, and _how much_ they should receive, is _challenging_ and _subjective_.

If a core team member finds a contribution valuable, this doesn't mean others did. Similarly, just because the core team did not appreciate the impact of a particular contribution, this doesn't mean that potentially hundreds of thousands of others didn't find immense value in the addition.

## We need your help! {#we-need-your-help}

We're taking ourselves out of the decision making, and allowing the community to decide. We need **signal and feedback** from the whole community to know which contributions have been most impactful! As such, ethereum.org will be utilizing Gitcoin's **Allo Protocol** to help distribute the funds in a more democratic way, optimizing for the most human impact.

## Allo Protocol {#allo-protocol}

Allo Protocol is a set of smart contracts that enable the democratic allocation and distribution of funds through the power of **quadratic funding **.

In short, quadratic funding is a mechanism for donation matching that takes into consideration how many unique people are signaling support to a recipient, rather than solely the amount of money a that recipient raised. Donations to recipients are then matched with funds from the matching pool, proportional to number of unique contributors, and to a lesser extent, the amount of money raised.

This prevents large donors from having disproportionate influence over the allocation of funds. A recipient with 100 small donations will receive significantly more matching funds at the end of the round than a project with a large donation from a single donor, even if the latter raised more money.
