## Office hours for translators {#office-hours}

We have office hours for translators on the second Wednesday of every month. These are held in the #office-hours voice channel on the [ethereum.org Discord](https://discord.gg/geKhWjtF), where you can also find the exact times and additional details.

Office hours allow our translators to ask questions about the translation process, provide feedback on the program, share their ideas, or just chat with the core ethereum.org team.
Finally, we want to use these calls to communicate recent developments with the Translation Program and share key tips and instructions with our contributors.

If you are an ethereum.org translator or would like to become one, feel free to join us during one of these sessions.
