The Translation Program is a collaborative effort to translate ethereum.org into different languages in order to make the website more accessible to billions of non-English speakers around the world.

Our progress so far:
**1,400 +** translators
**35** languages live on site
**1.4 million** words translated this year

If you want to get involved and help us grow the global Ethereum community by translating the website into your language, follow the steps below!

## How to join {#how-to-join}

1. **[Join our project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereumfoundation/invite)**  
   _You will need to create a Crowdin account if you don't already have one. Here's [documentation on how to use Crowdin](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/)_

2. **Find the language you want to translate and select a document. If translation progress is below 100%, please contribute! Don't see your language listed? [Open an issue](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/new/choose)**  
   _A note on content versions: we use version management within Crowdin to avoid translation delays for added content. When you check out a language, for example, [Filipino](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereumfoundation/fil#) you'll see folders for each site version ("v2.0", "v2.1", etc.)._
   _We encourage you to translate the lowest version first and work your way up to higher versions (v.2.0 → v.2.1 → v.2.2 → ⋯) as lower versions will be updated on the site first_
3. **Once you've completed the translation (i.e. all files for a content version display 100%), our professional translation service will review (and potentially edit) the content. Once the review is complete (i.e. review progress is 100%), we will add it to the website.**

Do you have any questions? Or want to collaborate with our team and other translators? Please post in the #translations channel of our [ethereum.org Discord server](https://discord.gg/6WX7E97)

Thank you for your participation in the ethereum.org Translation Program!

## Eth2 Launchpad Translations {#eth2-launchpad}

Our translation community is also working on the [Eth2 Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/). This allows anyone to set up an Ethereum validator and help secure the Ethereum network. The Launchpad is currently live in 15 languages.

If you're interested, [join the Eth2 Launchpad translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/launchpad-translation). You can [create an issue](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/new/choose) on GitHub to request the addition of a new language, if your language is not available in Crowdin.
