## What's decentralization? {#what-is-decentralization}

Decentralization is a design principle. You can use it to build things in the fields of finance, architecture, art, communications, government, and — you guessed it — computer science. The idea is simple: to create systems in which no individual or group can unilaterally make major decisions, especially not when it hurts the other participants.

"But I love centralized authority," you say? Unfortunately, centralized systems are prone to some serious risks:

- Accidental failure (bad decisions by corporate leadership teams, software bugs)
- Attacks that generate more money than they cost to execute (bank robberies, hardware manufactured with hidden vulnerability)
- Powerful people who conspire against less-powerful people (censorship, exploitation, monopolies)

Decentralized systems reduce these risks. It depends on the exact structure, but here are some examples of how:

- Diversity: Including diverse members and structural elements that (collectively) are unlikely to fail.
- Dispersion: Eliminating single points of failure and therefore increasing the cost of attacks.
- Mutuality: Creating networks in which corruption, collusion, and other bad actions would hurt the people trying to gain.
- Distribution: Distributing decision-making power so that it would be difficult (or at least unprofitable) for an individual member or group of members to obtain control or undue influence.
- Integrity: Building networks of people who work towards principles of decentralization (as opposed to a network of people who, say, buy a large amount of a single currency and then proceed to exaggerate the benefits of their choices while bashing all other projects on social media).
- Resistance: In general, building things that resist unwanted behavior instead of things that punish or mitigate it.

## Decentralized systems devalue trust {#trust-in-decentralization}

There's an inequitable economy of trustworthiness out there. Decentralized systems can disrupt it.

As you read more about crypto-world projects, you'll see terms like "trustless". These terms aren't exactly accurate: You need trust at some level. It's not complete paranoia. You just have more power over whom and what you choose to trust.

On Ethereum, Bitcoin, or any other open-source public blockchain project, all of the information about how it works is publicly available. You can look at the record of transactions, the code for the [client software](/glossary#node), the code for [smart contracts](/glossary#smart-contract) that you interact with, the [consensus algorithm](/glossary#consensus-rules), and so on. Yes, it takes some knowledge to understand blockchain stuff, but think about the supposedly familiar alternative.

You probably know multiple centralized payment-processing systems — Visa, Zelle, Western Union, Paypal, whatever. But do you know how these systems work?

You would have to learn a lot to be able to *prove* that these systems were trustworthy. Of course, the real barrier to detailed knowledge is social. Apart from learning the technical skills, you would need to secure a management position in the company to get access to the details.

When you look at it that way, the costs don't add up. Assuming you have zero technical knowledge, and that you need to prove that you could trust each payment processing system, here's the minimum you would need to invest:

- Visa: Dedicating your career to becoming an engineering lead at Visa. 
- Ethereum: An hour or two of [studying](/developers/docs/smart-contracts/languages/) [publicly](/developers/docs/) [available](/developers/tutorials/) [materials](/developers/learning-tools/) every day for 3-6 months.

Bonus: If you know anything at all about JavaScript or Python, you already have a huge head start.

## Decentralized systems can be more efficient {#efficiency-in-decentralization}

In addition to eliminating the need to trust third-party intermediaries, decentralized systems often reduce overhead in other ways. Let's look at Visa again, for example. When you (or the merchant selling you something, if you believe that merchants don't raise prices to cover payment processing fees) pay Visa a percentage of every purchase, you are paying for:

- The trusted position of Visa as a third party
- Visa's point-of-sale infrastructure
- Growth of the Visa corporation
- The cost of executing the transaction
- Undisclosed

In Ethereum, you pay: 

- The cost of running the network

On Ethereum specifically, you pay what's called [gas](/glossary#gas). Gas is a pretty complex subject, believe it or not, but it boils down to being a network fee — at least from your perspective as a user.

## Ethereum is the perfect decentralized system! Right? {#challenges-to-ethereum}

So, Ethereum is a perfect, utopian decentralized computing system, right? Not so fast.

The network works, but it's still a work in progress. Also, like most decentralized systems, Ethereum prioritizes some forms of decentralization over others. 

Becoming even more awesome is always on the agenda, though. Here are some things the community is working towards:

- Increased [client diversity](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients#advantages-of-different-implementations)
- Better geographical distribution of network operators (active participants in many different countries)
- Distribution of ETH balances (already one of the most even distributions in crypto)
- Increased cooperation between the Ethereum community and other decentralized projects (yes, even Bitcoin)
- Better communication between network operators, users, and software developers

As decentralized network participants, part of our job (should we choose to accept it) is to look for ways we can use and/or support this more equitable structure in our daily lives and our business ventures. Ready to get started?

## Centralized vs. decentralized {#centralized-vs-decentralized}

By now, you're probably tired of reading the words "centralized" and "decentralized". Hang in there!

The fact is that most systems have aspects of both types of design. Visa, for example, does not make you walk to the head office in Foster City to process your payments. 

These two design principles can and do coexist. For example, USDC is a United-States-Dollar-value cryptocurrency trading on multiple networks. It is tied to a national currency, which in turn is managed by a central bank. Further, the cryptocurrency itself is managed by a (Bermuda-based) company. This is relatively centralized. 

DAI is another dollar-value coin. DAI gets created through a program managed by a group called [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/), a [decentralized autonomous organization](glossary#dao). It is far more decentralized than USDC.

These two currencies seem similar at first glance. However, both the architectures behind them and the implications of using them are super different. 

USDC has some partnerships that might appeal to inexperienced cryptocurrency users. DAI would be a good option for those who value decentralization. Both are valid. So, the question really isn't which idea is better. It's which idea is better *for each end use*.

## Supporting the decentralized web {#node-operation}

Decentralized systems typically depend on individuals who run nodes. Are you an individual, by chance? If you have the basic hardware, you can run an Ethereum node at home. One of the best things you can do to support the ecosystem is [running one of the minority clients](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/23/supporting-ethereums-client-ecosystem/).

What's in it for you? You will have a cool computer networking project and you'll be contributing to the speed and defense of the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](/glossary#evm). Once your node is secure and you have the hang of it (and assuming you're running it on its own hardware), you can also use it as a DIY, standalone Ethereum wallet.

## Exploring the decentralized web {#decentralized-web}

There's a lot out there beyond Ethereum. Some systems might complement, serve, or empower this project, while others might declare (bombastically, usually) to be in competition. Hopefully, everyone succeeds. 

Please note that decentralization is not a monolithic concept. There are different types and varying degrees of it. Overall, some of these projects are not as decentralized as others in certain respects.

### Decentralized apps (dapps) {#dapps}

Decentralized apps are — wait for it — apps that follow decentralized design principles. There are a ton of these on Ethereum because the network allows for complex computing tasks, beyond sending coins from one address to another.

### Decentralized finance (defi) {#defi}

If you're sensing a pattern here, you're right: Defi is finance that follows decentralized design principles. Loans, securities, market indices, derivatives, even tokenized tokens — there's a lot out there.

### Storage (desto, maybe?) {#storage}

Blockchains like Etherereum's aren't the most efficient places for storing data. Luckily, there are various open protocols/paid services that provide decentralized, verifiable locations for your stuff:

- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
- [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) (based in part on IPFS)
- [Storj](https://storj.io/)

### File sharing {#filesharing}

- [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.org/introduction.html). No, it's not just for music pirates.

### Other blockchains {#blockchains}

There are other blockchain-based projects out there doing different things (or the same things, but with different marketing approaches). If decentralization is a priority for you, please remember that "blockchain" does not equal "decentralized". A blockchain with a central point of failure (i.e. a single governing authority that can make unilateral decisions) would have many of the same risks as a centralized system.

So, to start, let's look at an example, comparing centralized to decentralized decisionmaking.
Decentralization is everywhere in nature and in human organization. However, you're not going to find as much of it where there's a chance for a small number of people to grab and maintain control over a large amount of money, power, or material wealth. 
As a whole, the software, hardware, and people involved in a network like Ethereum should be able to resist corruption, influence, and error enough that everything keeps on working as expected. It's designed so people don't act contrary to the interests of the system, for example, so they don't have a reason or a chance to take everyone's ETH, cash out, and spend it all on Lamborghinis. 
In centralized systems, this is type of exploitation is arguably already happening — on many fronts. Regulation has not proved to be a sufficient check to self-interest.
Decentralized systems resist corruption of this kind not *in spite* of self interest, but *because* of it. We design decentralized systems to reduce the risk that the few can gain power over the many — not on idealistic principles but on practical ones. We build structures that eliminate efficient points of attack, distribute computing across great distances, and, overall, make it super-unprofitable to attack or exploit the network.
The only way you're taking down or exploiting an effective decentralized system is by committing nation-state-level resources to the attack. Even then, you're probably only benefiting. For your average greedy or malicious actor, that is not a very attractive proposition.
## Is Ethereum decentralized? {#ethereum-decentralization}
A major goal for Ethereum and many *but not all* other blockchain projects is to achieve the highest level of decentraliztion possible. Ethereum is doing pretty well, partly because it was built from the ground up to distribute authority as evenly as possible. 
Right off the bat, decentralization is a controversial idea. What if something goes wrong? How do you manage resources? How do you defend against malicious actors?
The difference between centralized and decentralized systems isn't whether they can handle governance challenges. The difference how they do it — and who retains the responsibility, power, and opportunity for self-determination that derive from leadership.
This article should help you understand the basics of decentralization. We'll look at how Ethereum is built, the machines that run it, the community that develops it, and more.
You can use the EVM to change this record (to send an ETH coin, for example) without going through a trusted third party (a bank, for example). In fact, you don't even have to trust the EVM itself. Everything about it is public, and, once you learn a few computer science basics, you can see exactly how everything works.
