# Discover community events and community hubs {#discover-community-events-and-community-hubs}

Ethereum comes alive through the people—from small meetups and community gatherings to major conferences, hackathons, and permanent Community Hubs that anchor local ecosystems around the world.

Every co-working day, meetup, or event is a chance to learn something new, meet like-minded people, share ideas, and collaborate on real projects that shape our future. Whether you’re a developer, researcher, designer, or just curious, there’s always a place for you to connect, contribute, and grow.

💡 Organizing an event or have a community idea in mind? Reach out to the Ethereum Everywhere team for support! → [Get in touch here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeA-W8iy2PJxrY3TD4lMYXyky_wLd4QB_7NRwqSxCd0e19MUg/viewform)
