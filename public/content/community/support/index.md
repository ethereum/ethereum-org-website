# Ethereum support {#support}

## Official Ethereum support {#official-support}

Are you looking for the official Ethereum support? The first thing you should know is that Ethereum is decentralized. This means no central organization, entity, or person owns Ethereum, and because of this, no official support channels exist.

Understanding the decentralized nature of Ethereum is vital because anyone claiming to be official support for Ethereum is probably trying to scam you! The best protection against scammers is educating yourself and taking security seriously.

Despite the lack of official support, many groups, communities, and projects across the Ethereum ecosystem are happy to help, and you can find a lot of useful information and resources on this page. Still have questions? Join the [ethereum.org Discord](/discord/), and we'll try to help.

## Frequently asked questions {#faq}

### I've sent ETH to the wrong wallet {#wrong-wallet}

A transaction sent on Ethereum is irreversible. Unfortunately, if you've sent ETH to the wrong wallet, there is no way to recover these funds. No one central organization, entity, or person owns Ethereum, which means no one can reverse transactions. Therefore, it is vital always to double-check your transactions before sending them.

### How can I claim my Ethereum giveaway? {#giveaway-scam}

Ethereum giveaways are scams designed to steal your ETH. Do not be tempted by offers that seem too good to be true â€” if you send ETH to a giveaway address, you will not receive a giveaway, and you will not be able to recover your funds.

### My transaction is stuck {#stuck-transaction}

Transactions on Ethereum can sometimes get stuck if you have submitted a lower transaction fee than is required due to network demand. Many wallets provide an option to resubmit the same transaction with a higher transaction fee to allow the transaction to be processed. Alternatively, you can cancel a pending transaction by sending a transaction to your own address and using the same nonce as the pending transaction.

### How do I mine Ethereum? {#mining-ethereum}

Ethereum mining is no longer possible. Mining was switched off when Ethereum moved from [proof-of-work](/glossary/#pow) to [proof-of-stake](/glossary/#pos). Now, instead of miners, Ethereum has validators. Anyone may [stake](/glossary/#staking) ETH and receive staking rewards for running validator software to secure the network.

### How do I become a staker / run a validator? {#how-to-stake}

To become a validator, you must stake 32 ETH in the Ethereum deposit contract and set up a validator node. More information is available on our [staking pages](/staking) and at [the staking launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/).
