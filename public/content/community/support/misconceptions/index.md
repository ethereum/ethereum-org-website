# Common misconceptions about Ethereum {#misconceptions}

## Ethereum is not a company {#not-a-company}

Ethereum is open-source, decentralized technology maintained by thousands of contributors worldwide. There is no company called "Ethereum" that manages accounts, holds funds, or provides customer support.

The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization that supports Ethereum's development, but it does not own or control the network. No single entity does.

**ethereum.org** is a community-run educational resource. It is not an exchange, wallet, or financial institution. It does not hold any user funds and cannot access any accounts.

## No one can access or freeze your funds {#no-fund-access}

Unlike a bank, there is no central authority on Ethereum that can freeze, seize, or recover funds. The person holding the private keys (or seed phrase) has full and sole control over a wallet.

This means:

- **No one can recover funds** you sent to the wrong address
- **No one can reverse** a transaction after it is confirmed
- **No one can freeze** your wallet or block your transactions
- **No one can reset** your password if you lose your seed phrase

This is why protecting your seed phrase is critical. It is the only way to access your wallet. If it is lost or stolen, there is no recovery option.

## Ethereum mining no longer exists {#no-mining}

Ethereum switched from [proof-of-work](/glossary/#pow) to [proof-of-stake](/glossary/#pos) during [The Merge](/roadmap/merge/) in September 2022. Mining is no longer possible on Ethereum.

The network is now secured by validators who [stake](/glossary/#staking) ETH. Anyone can participate:

- **Solo staking:** Run your own validator with 32 ETH — [learn more](/staking/solo/)
- **Staking as a service:** Delegate node operation while keeping your keys — [learn more](/staking/saas/)
- **Pooled staking:** Stake with less than 32 ETH by joining a pool — [learn more](/staking/pools/)

## There is no "Ethereum support team" {#no-support-team}

Because Ethereum is decentralized, there is no official support team, help desk, phone number, or email address. No one from Ethereum or ethereum.org will ever:

- Contact you via direct message
- Ask for your seed phrase or private keys
- Ask you to send ETH to verify your wallet
- Offer to help you recover funds for a fee

**Anyone doing any of the above is trying to scam you.**

If you need help, the real communities that can assist are listed on the [support page](/community/support/). These are volunteer-run, open communities — not official support channels.
