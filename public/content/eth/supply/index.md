# ETH Supply and Issuance {#eth-supply-and-issuance}

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

This article is written for beginners with no prior knowledge. However, to fully understand the topic, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of concepts such as [Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)](/eips/#introduction-to-ethereum-improvement-proposals), [Proof-of-work (PoW)](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/), [Proof-of-stake (PoS)](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/), and [The London Upgrade](/ethereum-forks/#london).

## How Many ETH Tokens Are There Today? {#current-eth-supply}

The total supply of ETH is dynamic and changes constantly due to two main factors:

1. **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Issuance**: New ETH is created as rewards for validators who secure the network
2. **EIP-1559 Burning**: A portion of transaction fees are permanently removed from circulation

You can track the current supply and these changes in real-time on platforms like [Ultrasound Money](https://ultrasound.money).

Ethereum's supply and issuance are essential metrics for understanding the health and future of the network. But what exactly does ETH issuance mean? Let's break it down.

## Why ETH Supply and Issuance Matter {#why-eth-supply-matters}

In traditional finance, central banks control the supply of money, often printing more to stimulate economies. Ethereum, on the other hand, operates on a transparent and predictable system governed by its code. Knowing how many ETH exist and how quickly new ETH is issued helps:

- **Build Trust**: The Ethereum community can verify supply and issuance data directly from the blockchain.
- **Understand Value**: The relationship between issuance and ETH burn rates impacts ETH's inflation or deflation, influencing its value over time.
- **Track Network Health**: Changes in issuance and burn rates reflect the activity and security of the network.

## What is ETH Issuance? {#eth-issuance}

ETH issuance refers to the process of creating new ETH as rewards for validators who secure the Ethereum network. It's separate from total supply, which is the total amount of ETH in circulation.

### In simple terms:
- **Issuance** adds new ETH to the network.
- **Burning** (introduced by EIP-1559) removes ETH from the network by destroying a portion of the transaction fees.

These two forces determine whether Ethereum's supply grows (inflationary) or shrinks (deflationary) over time.

## ETH Supply and Issuance Today {#eth-supply-today}

Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system has drastically reduced ETH issuance compared to its earlier Proof-of-Work (PoW) model. Validators—who lock up ETH to secure the network—earn ETH as rewards. You can see the current issuance rate on [Ultrasound Money](https://ultrasound.money).

However, this number is dynamic. Thanks to EIP-1559, when network activity is high, ETH burn rates can surpass issuance, creating a deflationary effect. For example, during periods of high demand, like NFT launches or DeFi activity, more ETH may be burned than issued.

## Factors Influencing Future ETH Supply and Issuance {#future-eth-supply}

Ethereum's future supply isn't fixed—it depends on several variables:

1. **Staking Participation**: 
   - More validators joining the network means more ETH rewards are distributed.
   - Fewer validators participating may decrease issuance.
   - Learn more about [staking](/staking/).

2. **Network Activity**:
   - High transaction volumes lead to more ETH being burned, potentially offsetting or exceeding issuance.
   - Read about [gas fees](/developers/docs/gas/) and how they affect burning.

3. **Protocol Upgrades**:
   - Future changes to Ethereum's code could adjust staking rewards or burning mechanisms, further shaping supply dynamics.
   - Stay updated with the [Ethereum roadmap](/roadmap/).

## Recap: ETH Supply, Issuance, and What's Next {#recap}

Here's a quick summary of what you need to know about ETH supply and issuance:

- **ETH Supply**: Dynamic and constantly changing, trackable in real-time through tools like [Ultrasound Money](https://ultrasound.money)
- **Issuance Under PoS**: Significantly reduced compared to PoW, with rewards going to validators. See current rates on [Ultrasound Money](https://ultrasound.money)
- **EIP-1559's Role**: ETH burning can make the network deflationary during periods of high activity
- **Future Trends**: Staking participation, network demand, and protocol updates will all shape ETH supply

Understanding ETH issuance helps demystify the value of Ethereum and its potential as a deflationary, decentralized asset.
