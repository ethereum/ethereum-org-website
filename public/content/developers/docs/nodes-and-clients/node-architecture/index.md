An Ethereum node is composed of two clients: an [execution client](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#execution-clients) and a [consensus client](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#consensus-clients). For a node to propose a new block, it must also run a [validator client](#validators).

When Ethereum was using [proof-of-work](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/), an execution client was enough to run a full Ethereum node. However, since implementing [proof-of-stake](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/), the execution client must be used alongside another piece of software called a [consensus client](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#consensus-clients).

The diagram below shows the relationship between the two Ethereum clients. The two clients connect to their own respective peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Separate P2P networks are needed as the execution clients gossip transactions over their P2P network, enabling them to manage their local transaction pool, whilst the consensus clients gossip blocks over their P2P network, enabling consensus and chain growth.

_There are several options for the execution client including Erigon, Nethermind, and Besu_.

For this two-client structure to work, consensus clients must pass bundles of transactions to the execution client. The execution client executes the transactions locally to validate that the transactions do not violate any Ethereum rules and that the proposed update to Ethereumâ€™s state is correct. When a node is selected to be a block producer its consensus client instance requests bundles of transactions from the execution client to include in the new block and execute them to update the global state. The consensus client drives the execution client via a local RPC connection using the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/common.md). 

## What does the execution client do? {#execution-client}

The execution client is responsible for transaction validation, handling, and gossip, along with state management and supporting the Ethereum Virtual Machine ([EVM](/developers/docs/evm/)). It is **not** responsible for block building, block gossiping or handling consensus logic. These are in the remit of the consensus client.

The execution client creates execution payloads - the list of transactions, updated state trie, and other execution-related data. Consensus clients include the execution payload in every block. The execution client is also responsible for re-executing transactions in new blocks to ensure they are valid. Executing transactions is done on the execution client's embedded computer, known as the [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](/developers/docs/evm).

The execution client also offers a user interface to Ethereum through [RPC methods](/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc) that enable users to query the Ethereum blockchain, submit transactions and deploy smart contracts. It's common for RPC calls to be handled by a library like [Web3js](https://docs.web3js.org/), [Web3py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/v5/), or by a user-interface such as a browser wallet.

In summary, the execution client is:

- a user gateway to Ethereum
- home to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Ethereum's state and transaction pool.

## What does the consensus client do? {#consensus-client}

The consensus client deals with all the logic that enables a node to stay in sync with the Ethereum network. This includes receiving blocks from peers and running a fork choice algorithm to ensure the node always follows the chain with the greatest accumulation of attestations (weighted by validator effective balances). Similar to the execution client, consensus clients have their own P2P network through which they share blocks and attestations.

The consensus client does not participate in attesting to or proposing blocks - this is done by a validator, an optional add-on to a consensus client. A consensus client without a validator only keeps up with the head of the chain, allowing the node to stay synced. This enables a user to transact with Ethereum using their execution client, confident that they are on the correct chain.

## Validators {#validators}

Staking and running the validator software makes a node eligible to be selected to propose a new block. Node operators can add a validator to their consensus clients by depositing 32 ETH in the deposit contract. The validator client comes bundled with the consensus client and can be added to a node at any time. The validator handles attestations and block proposals. It also enables a node to accrue rewards or lose ETH via penalties or slashing.
