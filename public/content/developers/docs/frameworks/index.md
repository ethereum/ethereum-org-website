## Introduction to frameworks {#introduction-to-frameworks}

Building a full-fledged dapp requires
different pieces of technology. Software frameworks include many of the needed
features or provide easy plugin systems to pick the tools you
desire.

Frameworks come with a lot of out-of-the-box functionality,
like:

- Features to spin up a local blockchain instance.
- Utilities to compile and test your smart contracts.
- Client development add-ons to build your user-facing application
  within the same project/repository.
- Configuration to connect to Ethereum networks and deploy
  contracts, whether to a locally running instance, or one of
  Ethereum's public networks.
- Decentralized app distribution - integrations with storage
  options like IPFS.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before diving into frameworks, we recommend you first read through our introduction to [dapps](/developers/docs/dapps/) and the [Ethereum stack](/developers/docs/ethereum-stack/).
