## Working with Ethereum clients {#working-with-ethereum-clients}

You can use Ethereum to create decentralized applications (or "dapps") that utilize the benefits of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.
There are at least two currently maintained libraries for Dart to use the
[JSON-RPC API](/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) for Ethereum.

1. [Web3dart from simonbutler.eu](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart)
1. [Ethereum 5.0.0 from darticulate.com](https://pub.dev/packages/ethereum)

There are also additional libraries that allow you to manipulate specific Ethereum addresses,
or that let you retrieve prices of various cryptocurrencies.
[You can see the full list here](https://pub.dev/dart/packages?q=ethereum).
