## Intro (0:00)

**Ryan:** Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance. You are in for a treat today. We've got two experts on Proof of Stake and Proof of Work, and they are debating which is better for creating a global crypto money system. Lyn Alden and Justin Drake are on the episode today.

We're going to talk about a few things. Number one, which provides the most economic security — Proof of Work or Proof of Stake? Number two, which provides the best deterrence and recoverability in the face of the dreaded 51% attack? Number three, which minimizes governance power for the elites — which is more power to the people? Number four, which is economically the fairest system to participate in? And number five, this personally is my favorite — this conversation around Proof of Work being more like commodity money and Proof of Stake being more like equity money. Is that correct? That's what one of our debaters believes, and we dive into that as well.

**David:** The first half of the episode just wrote itself. Seriously, I debated going back and making a bag of popcorn because as hosts we didn't have to do a damn thing. Lyn and Justin just took it upon themselves and took this conversation in their own direction. Then in the second half of the show, Ryan and I really started to direct the conversation, summarize things that were said, and digest what was discussed.

I'm very happy that in this very tribal world of crypto, we have people like Lyn Alden and Justin Drake who can come to a podcast and just talk about things without the yelling you would find on Twitter Spaces. A very respectful conversation, which I know is important for the listeners.

**Ryan:** Imagine having an adult conversation about crypto — it's almost impossible on Crypto Twitter. But that's what was had today. Fantastic points by both sides, well articulated.

## Backgrounds (6:15)

**Ryan:** All right, so we've got two incredible guests today. We'll start quick with backgrounds and then get right into the topic. Lyn, introduce yourself for folks who might not know you.

**Lyn:** My name's Lyn Alden. I run an investment research firm called Lyn Alden Investment Strategy. I've been investing and doing engineering work for over 15 years, and I've been in the Bitcoin space since 2020, though I'd been watching it for years before that. I published an article last year on Proof of Work versus Proof of Stake, which is partly what triggered this debate.

**Justin:** My name is Justin Drake. I'm a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation. I've been working there for the past five years, and my focus is on consensus — particularly how to make Ethereum's Proof of Stake as robust and efficient as possible.

## The better monetary premium (8:12)

**Ryan:** So let's start here. Lyn, you have this thesis that Proof of Work systems produce better money — specifically that they produce a better monetary premium. Can you give us the overview of that thesis?

**Lyn:** The way I look at it is through the lens of what historically acquires a monetary premium, which is things that are the hardest, the most immutable, and the most resistant to supply increases. If you're designing a blockchain to maximize monetary properties, you would make one where almost the entire purpose is to be money — you would sacrifice everything else. You want the simplest possible system, the most decentralized, the most immutable, with the least amount of governance.

Proof of Work achieves this because it's like non-volatile memory — it doesn't have to be continuously online to function correctly. It's self-verifiable and self-correcting, and it requires the least amount of governance intervention. Proof of Stake, by contrast, is inherently more complex. It's like volatile memory — you have to be continually online to be as trustless as possible.

**Justin:** I like to think in technical terms, so these traditional labels of equity versus commodity make me somewhat uncomfortable. I think the case could be made that both BTC and ETH have commodity properties and both have equity properties. For me, equity has two aspects: one is financial exposure to upside for a project, and I think all blockchains with tokens have this. The other is the voting aspect, and I would argue both BTC and ETH tokens are non-voting.

## Equity, PoS, commodity, PoW? (11:00)

**David:** Lyn, is it the case that you believe any kind of Proof of Stake monetary premium is more like equity and less like a commodity? Is there some granularity in your belief?

**Lyn:** I think there is some degree of spectrum, but for the most part it's a rather one-directional street. There are multiple ways to become an equity but very few ways to maintain true commodity status in the digital realm. That's why I bring up the block size wars — even in Proof of Work, there are multiple traps to fall into that create a system more equity-like, where those with capital and outsized influence can control the network.

**David:** Do you think part of the difference is ossification? Some networks like Bitcoin have far fewer governance decisions to make, since it's kind of done, but something like Ethereum — whether Proof of Stake or Proof of Work — still has work to do. Vitalik said recently it's somewhere between 50% and 60% complete.

**Lyn:** That is a useful distinction, but I would say even an ossified Proof of Stake system still wouldn't have the same monetary premium as a Proof of Work system. In addition, when you go down to the complexity of the code, Proof of Stake is far more complex compared to Proof of Work. I'm not saying Proof of Stake has no use cases — saying that something is a digital equity is not saying it's worthless. It's just saying it's not a digital commodity.

If something crazy happened, like the internet going down for a month, a Proof of Work system like Bitcoin can just restart. A Proof of Stake system requires more of a manual restart because it's not a system designed to function when it's not continually online.

**Justin:** I want to ask Lyn a simple question. You mentioned that capital holders have outsized power in a Proof of Stake system. But consider what happens with Proof of Work: the miners, the people who have massive capital investments, also have enormously outsized influence. The difference is that in Proof of Stake, anyone can participate by staking — the barrier to entry is just having a computer running 24/7 and 32 ETH. In Proof of Work, to be a profitable miner today, you need industrial-scale operations.

I don't know anyone who mines Bitcoin as an individual at this point. It's all industrial. On the other hand, with Proof of Stake, everyone on this call — maybe except you, Lyn — is literally staking as individuals. The diversity in Proof of Stake is much larger and the barrier to entry much lower.

**Lyn:** There's a key distinction though. In a pre-mined, Proof of Stake system, those who bought in at the early stage have a permanent structural advantage for the rest of time, as long as they continue to hold their stake. Proof of Work requires an ongoing series of good decisions to maintain your ability to participate.

When we look at the direction of Proof of Work over the longer term, you'll see increasing integration between miners and energy producers. The cheapest source of electricity is virtually zero-cost stranded energy — small sources around the world that are too small for large entities to deal with. Last I checked, the biggest Bitcoin mining facility is about 1% of total hash rate. It's already structurally decentralized, and I think it only becomes more so.

**Justin:** In practice, what we see is that there are huge centralization forces in mining. There are supply chain risks — what if TSMC or GlobalFoundries creates their own rigs? We've seen that with Intel building their own chips. That's a massive centralization vector. Making a chip is at least 10 million dollars; for a three-nanometer chip, the minimum investment might be 30 million. The barrier to entry to be competitive is much higher than just running a staking node.

## Hypothetical PoS Bitcoin (23:30)

**David:** Here's a thought experiment: imagine we had Bitcoin but with Proof of Stake. Same monetary policy, same 21 million cap, same everything — just Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work. Lynn, would that be a worse money?

**Lyn:** Yes, I think it would be worse. The strength of Bitcoin currently is that you have the simplest possible code, distributed among as many machines as you can get, with as few governance decisions as possible. If you swapped in Proof of Stake, you'd add significant code complexity, which adds attack surface and bug surface. You'd move from non-volatile to volatile memory. You'd increase the governance surface area. All of those things reduce the monetary premium.

**Justin:** I'd actually argue the opposite. If Bitcoin adopted Proof of Stake, it would gain massive economic security advantages. Right now, Bitcoin's economic security — the cost to 51% attack it — is basically the cost of renting hash power, which is far less than 1% of Bitcoin's market cap. With Proof of Stake, the cost to attack would scale directly with the market cap. You'd need to acquire a significant percentage of the total token supply, which becomes enormously expensive.

## Lyn's rebuttal to multiple Justin claims (30:25)

**Lyn:** I want to address several of Justin's points. First, on security, it's not just about 51% attacks — it's also about bugs. Proof of Stake is inherently far more complex, which means greater attack surfaces and greater bug surfaces. I'll grant that in a world where everything works perfectly, Proof of Stake has a higher cost of attack. But the downside is the increased complexity.

Second, regarding staking versus mining as a source of control: staking requires little to no entropy. Once you hold the power, you accrue more power. In mining, it's a very capital-intensive business. You have to constantly put in fresh capital to maintain those rewards, and it historically has been a very rough business to operate in. Mining actually doesn't accrue a lot of value for the miners other than on the margins.

Third, on recovery from attacks: in Proof of Stake, the only way to respond is to soft fork and confiscate people's capital. If you phrase it as "taking the attacker's capital," that sounds fine. But if the attacker is a regulated custodian, you're taking the capital of people who had nothing to do with the attack. Their coins were captured and used against the network — you're splitting participants. In Proof of Work, the system is self-regenerative. More hash capacity can come online, and new entrants have an advantage over existing attackers.

## Justin's rebuttal to multiple Lyn claims (36:05)

**Justin:** I'm happy to respond point by point. On the complexity argument — yes, Proof of Stake is more complex than Proof of Work at the consensus layer. But the complexity of the overall system is comparable. Bitcoin might have simpler consensus, but it also has Lightning Network, Taproot, and various other layers that add complexity. And importantly, the consensus layer is just one part of the system. The execution layer, the networking layer, the applications layer — these are all complex regardless of the consensus mechanism.

On the "rich get richer" argument about staking: I'd push back on this significantly. Bitcoin mining has enormous economies of scale — access to cheap energy, ability to negotiate with chip fabricators, expertise in firmware optimization. The returns on capital for an industrial miner far exceed what a retail miner can achieve. With staking, the returns are exactly the same percentage regardless of how much you stake. There's no economy of scale effect. A person staking 32 ETH gets the same percentage return as someone staking 32,000 ETH.

On attack recovery: Proof of Stake actually has a massive advantage here. The social layer has tools to intervene because stakers are identified on-chain. You can slash an attacker's stake. In Proof of Work, after a 51% attack, the attacker's mining hardware still exists and still has value — they could attack again. In Proof of Stake, a slashed attacker's stake is burned. The attack is one-shot, and it's enormously expensive, whereas in Proof of Work, a nation-state could rent hash power, execute the attack, and the hardware still retains its value.

## Inherently fair or unfair? (44:50)

**David:** Let's talk about fairness. Which system is inherently fairer for participants?

**Lyn:** In Proof of Work, you need to make an ongoing series of good decisions to maintain your position. The cheapest energy sources are small stranded energy sources around the world, and smaller entities sometimes have an advantage because they can go to places that are too small for bigger operations. There's almost no economy of scale in energy sourcing, which is the primary cost driver.

**Justin:** In Proof of Stake, anyone can participate with relatively modest resources — a computer running 24/7 and 32 ETH. The returns are proportional regardless of scale. In Proof of Work, in order to be profitable, you need to operate at industrial scale. You can't just be a retail miner with one rig — it just doesn't work economically. You need specialized know-how, custom firmware, relationships with fabricators. The barrier to entry is fundamentally higher.

The fairness question also extends to the environmental dimension. Proof of Work consumes an enormous amount of electricity. Ethereum's switch to Proof of Stake reduced its energy consumption by approximately 99.95%. Whether mining uses renewable energy or stranded energy, it's still consuming resources that could be used elsewhere. Proof of Stake achieves the same consensus with a tiny fraction of the energy.

**Lyn:** I think the environmental argument is more nuanced. Proof of Work acts as a load balancer for the electrical grid. It naturally seeks out the cheapest, most stranded energy sources — the kind that would otherwise be wasted. It incentivizes development of energy capacity in areas where it wouldn't otherwise be economical, which ultimately benefits the broader grid.

## Different kinds of risk (53:27)

**Ryan:** Let's talk about different kinds of risk. Both systems face different risk profiles, right?

**Lyn:** When it comes to creating the best possible money, you want something that is extraordinarily simple. The most extremely secure things purposely change very slowly, over decades. The U.S. Air Force used eight-inch floppy disks as part of their nuclear code launch process up until literally three years ago. That sounds hilarious, but the whole point is they kept it extremely simple, updated very slowly, and disconnected it from everything else. When it comes to the software that manages the nuclear system, you want it to be absolutely rock solid — to do nothing else other than not have bugs.

The same applies to money. When it comes to an asset that is suitable for a corporate treasury, or for allocating part of an endowment, or for holding 10% or more of your net worth, or for managing sovereign reserves representing decades of accumulated trade surpluses — you select the most decentralized, the most immutable, the one that doesn't sacrifice any of those characteristics to do other things.

**Justin:** I think this is where we have a fundamental philosophical difference. Lyn prioritizes simplicity and minimal change as risk reduction. I prioritize provable economic security as risk reduction. The risk of a 51% attack on a Proof of Work chain with relatively low hash rate revenue is not theoretical — it has happened multiple times on smaller Proof of Work chains. Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Gold — they were 51% attacked. Proof of Stake chains of equivalent value haven't faced the same issue because the cost of attack scales with the stake.

## Client diversity (57:30)

**Ryan:** Let's talk about client diversity. This seems to be a big topic for Ethereum specifically.

**Justin:** Client diversity is incredibly important for network health. In Ethereum, we have multiple independent implementations of the protocol — multiple execution clients and multiple consensus clients. If a bug is found in one client, the network continues to function because other clients don't share the same bug. This is a massive advantage for resilience.

Currently, we have ongoing work to improve client diversity. We want no single client to have more than 50% of the network, and ideally no more than 33%. This gives us protection against bugs taking down the network.

**Lyn:** I think that's important, but it's worth noting that Bitcoin also has multiple implementations, and the simplicity of its consensus rules makes client diversity somewhat less critical — there's just less surface area for bugs. The simpler the protocol, the easier it is to write correct implementations.

**Justin:** That's fair, but I'd argue the flip side: Ethereum's Proof of Stake system was designed with client diversity as a first-class concern. The incentive structures actually encourage it — if your client has a bug and goes down, you lose more if you're in the majority client. It's economically incentivized diversity, which I think is a novel and important property.

## Lyn's macro perspective (1:03:00)

**David:** Lyn, you approach things from a macro perspective. Can you share how this fits into the broader monetary landscape?

**Lyn:** When we look at the existing monetary system — the Federal Reserve, central banking — it's essentially a Proof of Stake system. The Federal Reserve Banks are owned by commercial banks, which have their representation based on their capital, their initial stake in the system. Then you have the Federal Reserve Board, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. When you look at the Federal Open Market Committee, you have the seven reserve board governors appointed by the government and a rotating group of five of the twelve bank presidents — this hodgepodge mix of federally appointed and bank-appointed officials determining the policy for that network.

Over time, that system tends towards centralization — as debt builds up, the system gets increasingly captured by government because they have to monetize debts and bail out the system. With the invention of Bitcoin, you have the reintroduction of commodity money that allows people to opt into a different system.

One thing I'd point out is that the more any given system tries to do, usually the worse it's going to be at any one thing. As Ethereum has tried to somewhat harden its monetary policy, it has arguably lost market share in DeFi. In late 2020, Ethereum had something like 97% of total value locked market share; now it's down to about 55%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin doesn't really have competition from other systems in the "digital gold" category.

So you have these two different worlds — one based more on governance and making your ecosystem as attractive as possible, and the other coming down to which one is the hardest and essentially the best at being money.

**David:** How much of this is a technical objective argument versus a subjective argument about what people think is more equitable?

**Lyn:** I personally approach it more from a tactical risk perspective. I look at what system is least likely to have tail risks, what system is optimized for what it's trying to do. I approach this as someone who owns dozens of different stocks — I'm happy with diversification. The only challenge is that in this ecosystem, it's inherently very speculative. You basically have one that looks the most Lindy — 13 years of operating history, very simple Proof of Work — and then a large number of venture-capital-type investments that are rapidly innovating and competing on capturing market share.

## Justin's technical perspective (1:13:00)

**Justin:** I want to respond to a few things. The comparison to the Federal Reserve as a Proof of Stake system — I think that's reaching quite far. The Federal Reserve is a permissioned system with regulatory capture, appointed positions, and no slashing conditions. Proof of Stake in Ethereum is permissionless, transparent, and has credible commitment to rules via slashing.

On the DeFi market share point: Ethereum's DeFi market share decline has nothing to do with Proof of Stake versus Proof of Work. It's about execution — Layer 2 scaling, alternative Layer 1 competition on cost and speed. Many of those competing chains are also Proof of Stake. Ethereum had near-monopoly DeFi share not because of its consensus mechanism but because it was the only game in town.

The comparison I'd make is this: in terms of raw economic security numbers, let's look at what they actually are. Ethereum currently has about 26 million ETH staked, worth roughly 40 billion dollars. To 51% attack Ethereum, you'd need to acquire over 13 million ETH — an act that would be practically impossible without enormously driving up the price. Bitcoin's hash rate security, by comparison, is on the order of 15–20 million dollars per hour. The cost asymmetry between attacking Proof of Stake versus Proof of Work is enormous.

## Governance and memes (1:17:42)

**Ryan:** Let's talk about governance. Justin, you've said some provocative things about how Proof of Stake gives more governance power to the community. Can you elaborate?

**Justin:** In a Proof of Stake system, governance ultimately rests with the users — the people running nodes and validating the chain. Validators cannot change the rules of the system; they can only choose whether to process transactions or not. The rules — the "law" of the blockchain — are set by the social layer, the users. Validators are like workers in a factory; they can go on strike, but they can't change the product.

In Proof of Work, the miners have exactly the same power — they can't change the rules either. But there's a critical difference in how the community can respond to misbehavior. In Proof of Stake, if validators start censoring transactions, the community can identify them and slash their stake. In Proof of Work, if miners start censoring, the only recourse is to change the mining algorithm — essentially the nuclear option that restarts the entire security infrastructure from scratch.

**Lyn:** I'd push back on that characterization. The beauty of Proof of Work is that responding to an attack is self-correcting without governance intervention in most cases. If an attacker is 51% attacking the network, honest miners have incentive to bring more hash power online. If you're a large Bitcoin holder and Bitcoin is being attacked, you now have an incentive to fund hash power — it might not be profitable at first, but you're making an investment to unlock your Bitcoin transactions.

The nuclear option in Proof of Work — changing the algorithm — does exist but is reserved for truly extreme scenarios. And that's actually a feature, not a bug: the fact that the system can self-correct without governance intervention in normal adversarial scenarios is exactly what makes it more like a commodity and less like an equity.

**David:** This is where I think there's a philosophical difference. Justin is saying Proof of Stake gives the community more fine-grained tools to respond to attacks. Lyn is saying the fact that Proof of Work needs fewer tools is precisely what makes it better money.

**Lyn:** Exactly. When it comes to creating the perfect money, you want a system that is extraordinarily simple and resistant. The more governance tools you add, the more governance surface area you create. The ideal money is something where governance intervention is almost never needed.

## The rich get richer? (1:29:55)

**Ryan:** One of the big criticisms of Proof of Stake is this "rich get richer" argument — that those who hold more stake earn more rewards and increase their share over time. Justin, how do you respond to that?

**Justin:** This criticism is simply incorrect when you understand the math. In Proof of Stake, everyone earns the same percentage return regardless of how much they stake. If you stake 32 ETH and I stake 32,000 ETH, we both earn the same percentage. Your share of the network does not change over time due to staking rewards.

Compare this to Proof of Work mining, where the economies of scale are enormous. If you have access to a chip fabricator, cheaper electricity through industrial contracts, and specialized firmware, you earn disproportionately higher returns than a retail participant. The rich literally do get richer in Proof of Work mining in percentage terms. In Proof of Stake, the returns are flat — there's no economy of scale.

**Lyn:** I think the distinction is that in Proof of Work, maintaining your position requires continuous capital expenditure and ongoing competitive decisions. In Proof of Stake, the advantage is passive and structural — once you hold the power, you accrue more power without additional effort or risk. That passive compounding dynamic is fundamentally different from the active, competitive, capital-intensive nature of mining.

## Closing arguments (1:32:35)

**Ryan:** Final question — closing arguments. Justin, you go first. Why is Proof of Stake the best way to create a crypto money?

**Justin:** If we're talking about what makes the best money, we need to talk about what properties matter: security, decentralization, and sustainability. Proof of Stake is superior on all three dimensions.

On security: the cost to attack a Proof of Stake network scales linearly with the value of the network. Ethereum has approximately 40 billion dollars of economic security. To 51% attack it, you'd need to acquire a significant fraction of the total stake, at a cost that makes it economically irrational. With Proof of Work, the cost of attack is the cost of renting hash power — a tiny fraction of market cap.

On decentralization: anyone can be a validator with a consumer computer and 32 ETH. There's no need for specialized hardware, relationships with chip fabricators, or access to industrial-scale energy. The Ethereum staking set has hundreds of thousands of validators distributed globally.

On sustainability: Proof of Stake achieves the same security guarantees with approximately 99.95% less energy consumption. This isn't just environmentally beneficial — it's economically rational. Why burn billions of dollars in electricity when you can achieve the same outcome with cryptoeconomic guarantees?

Finally, there's attack recoverability. If a Proof of Stake network is attacked, the attacker's stake is destroyed — they can't attack again. In Proof of Work, the attacker's hardware retains its value. They could attack, profit, and potentially attack again.

The numbers on Ethereum's economic security are very dense, but they're also backed by real fundamentals.

**Lyn:** Historically, when we look at things that acquire monetary premium, it's the things that are the hardest, the most immutable — things that technology cannot come in and find a better replacement for or increase the supply of. What you want is something where the vast majority of its value is the monetary premium and very little is the utility premium. Like gold, where the vast majority is held for its monetary premium and very little is used in industry, compared to something like oil that is entirely for its utility value.

If I want to make the best possible fork, it would just be a fork — it wouldn't be a fork and a spoon and a knife combined together, because that instrument is going to be worse at all three things than the three separate instruments are at their own specialty.

The perfect money is willing to sacrifice everything else in order to have the perfect attributes of money. It should be extraordinarily simple, the most decentralized, the most immutable, the one that doesn't sacrifice any of those characteristics to do other things. The most extremely secure things in the world purposely change slowly over decades, because any new complexity introduces risks.

When it comes to an asset suitable for a corporate treasury, endowment, or sovereign reserves — you select the one that is most decentralized, most immutable. Proof of Work achieves this: it's the simplest system, it's like non-volatile memory that doesn't have to be continuously online, it's self-verifiable and self-correcting, and it requires the least amount of governance.

That's how I view this whole ecosystem. I separate assets that are trying to be money from assets that are trying to be operating systems. Both can be valuable — just as gold having value doesn't mean Tesla stock doesn't have value. They're just two totally different things doing different things.

**Ryan:** What a fantastic conversation. I want to thank Lyn Alden and Justin Drake for having the best debate I've ever heard about Proof of Work versus Proof of Stake. A special thanks to Lyn because I know Bankless leans Ethereum pretty heavily, so coming into what others might perceive as the away team, I really appreciate that.
