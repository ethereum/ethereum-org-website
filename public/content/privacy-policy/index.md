**3. Data processing in connection with the Websites**

**3.1 Visiting our Websites**

When you visit our Websites, the hosting provider(s) of our Websites may automatically collect and store various information in server log files that your browser transmits to us. The information/data mentioned is neither assigned to specific persons nor linked to data from other sources. The following technical data may be recorded by us, as usual with every connection with a web server, without your intervention, and stored by us until automatic deletion after no later than two days:

- Woocommerce cart data
- Unique identification code for Woocommerce customer
- Anonymized IP addresses

Any collection and processing of this technical data is for the purpose of enabling the use of our Websites, continuously ensuring system security and stability, optimising our Websites, and for internal statistical purposes. This is our legitimate interest in the processing of data in the sense of Art. 6 Par. 1 lit. f GDPR.

Furthermore, the IP addresses may be evaluated, together with other data, in case of attacks on the network infrastructure or other unauthorised use or misuse of the Websites, for the purpose of intelligence and protection, and if appropriate, used in criminal proceedings for identification and civil and criminal proceedings against the relevant users. This is our legitimate interest in the processing of data in the sense of Art. 6 Par. 1 lit. f GDPR.

**3.2 Use of Website Cookies**

The Websites may use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser. More detailed information on cookies and how they work can be found at: <http://www.allaboutcookies.org>.

Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.

Through the use of cookies, the Foundation may provide the users of the Websites with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.

Cookies may allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our Website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our Websites. The Website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the Website is accessed, because this is taken over by the Website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.

You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our Websites by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, previously set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, it may not be possible to use all the functions of our Websites.

For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them, see our Cookie Policy.

**3.3 Matomo Analytics**

The Websites may use Matomo, an open source web analytics platform ("Matomo Analytics"). Where this is true, the information generated by the cookies about your use of the Websites (including your automatically anonymized IP address) may be stored on the servers of our hosting provider(s) in the United States. For more information about Matomo Analytics, you can access a demo version at: https://demo.matomo.cloud.

Before the data is stored, the IP address will be abbreviated by activating IP anonymization (anonymizeIP) on this Website.

In addition to the data listed in section 3.1, we may receive the following information because of Matomo Analytics:

- Usage data;
- Navigation path;
- Length of stay on the Website;
- Returning or new user; and/or
- End device.

We may use this technical data to analyze your use of the Websites by compiling reports on Website activity for the understanding and/or optimizing of our Websites and/or for internal statistical purposes. We do not use the information and personal data collected by Matomo to identify individuals unless we become aware of specific indications of illegal use.

Any processing of this technical personal data helps us to identify what is working and what is not on our Websites and how we may improve our Websites. Without any data thus received, we may not be able to provide you the service we are currently offering to you. Your data will be used only to improve the user experience on our Websites and help you find the information you are looking for. This is our legitimate interest in the processing of data in the sense of Art. 6 Par. 1 lit. f GDPR.

With the exception of the provider(s) of our Websites, we do not make your personal data available to third parties unless you have expressly consented to it, if we are legally obligated to, or if this is necessary to enforce our rights concerning a contractual relationship.

Personal data collected via the Websites may be passed on to and/or accessed by the Website service provider(s). The Websites may be hosted on servers in the US.

Please note that any data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) is generally not secure and we accept no liability for data transmitted to us via the Internet. Unfortunately, absolute protection is not technically possible.
