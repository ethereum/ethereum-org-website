# What are blockchains? {#what-are-blockchains}

A blockchain is a special kind of database or digital ledger that securely records transactions across a network of computers. Think of it as a chain of blocks, where each block contains a batch of transaction records. These blocks are linked together in a sequence, creating a "chain." Once a block is added to the chain, the information within it is nearly impossible to change, which makes the blockchain secure and reliable.

One of the unique aspects of a blockchain is that it is decentralized. This means that no single person, company, or government controls it. Instead, it's maintained by a network of computers (often referred to as nodes) that work together to verify and record transactions. This decentralized structure is key to the security and trustworthiness of blockchain technology.

### How does a blockchain work? {#how-blockchain-works}

When a new transaction is made, it is grouped with other transactions into a block. This block is then sent out to the network, where the computers (nodes) verify the transactions using complex algorithms. Once verified, the block is added to the chain in a way that links it to the previous block. This process ensures that all transactions are recorded in the correct order and that they cannot be altered after being added to the blockchain.

Each block in the chain contains a unique code called a "hash," which is like a digital fingerprint. The hash of one block is included in the next block, linking them together. If anyone tried to tamper with a block, its hash would change, breaking the chain and alerting the network to the tampering. This makes blockchains very secure.

# What are cryptocurrencies? {#what-are-cryptocurrencies}

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use blockchain technology to operate. Unlike traditional currencies, which are issued and controlled by governments, cryptocurrencies are decentralized. This means they are not regulated by any central authority, like a bank or government. Instead, they rely on the security and transparency provided by blockchain technology.

Bitcoin, created in 2009, was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most well-known. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been developed, including Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple. These digital currencies can be used for various purposes, such as purchasing goods and services, investing, or transferring money across borders.

### How do cryptocurrencies work? {#how-cryptocurrencies-work}

Cryptocurrencies work by using blockchain technology to record and verify transactions. When someone sends cryptocurrency to another person, the transaction is added to a block on the blockchain. This block is then verified by the network of computers before being added to the chain.

One of the key features of cryptocurrencies is that they are secure and difficult to counterfeit. This is because the blockchain ensures that every transaction is recorded and cannot be altered. Additionally, cryptocurrencies often use cryptographic techniques to protect users' identities and keep transactions private.

# What are the benefits of blockchains and cryptocurrencies? {#benefits-of-blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies}

Both blockchains and cryptocurrencies offer several advantages over traditional financial systems:

### 1. Security {#security}

The decentralized nature of blockchains makes them highly secure. Since no single entity controls the entire system, it is extremely difficult for hackers to tamper with or alter the information stored on a blockchain. Additionally, the use of cryptography ensures that transactions are secure and that users' identities are protected.

### 2. Transparency {#transparency}

All transactions made on a blockchain are recorded and visible to everyone on the network. This level of transparency helps build trust among users, as they can verify that the transactions are legitimate and that no one is manipulating the system. Transparency also reduces the risk of fraud and corruption.

### 3. Lower Costs {#lower-costs}

Traditional financial systems often involve intermediaries, such as banks or payment processors, which can add fees and delays to transactions. Blockchains and cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for these intermediaries, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. This is particularly beneficial for international transfers, where traditional fees can be high.

### 4. Accessibility {#accessibility}

Cryptocurrencies can be accessed and used by anyone with an internet connection, regardless of their location. This makes them particularly useful for people in regions where traditional banking services are limited or unavailable. Cryptocurrencies provide a way for these individuals to participate in the global economy and manage their finances.

### 5. Privacy {#privacy}

Cryptocurrencies allow users to make transactions without revealing their identities, offering a level of privacy not available with traditional banking. This is achieved through the use of cryptographic techniques that protect users' information while still ensuring the integrity of the transaction.

# How do cryptocurrencies compare to fiat currencies? {#cryptocurrencies-vs-fiat-currencies}

Fiat currencies, such as the US dollar or the euro, are government-issued and regulated by central banks. They exist in both physical form (coins and bills) and digital form (bank accounts and electronic transfers). Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, exist only in digital form and are not regulated by any central authority.

### Fiat Currencies {#fiat-currencies}
- **Centralized Control:** Fiat currencies are issued and regulated by governments and central banks, which control the money supply and monetary policy.
- **Physical and Digital Form:** Fiat currencies can be used as physical cash or in digital transactions.
- **Stability:** Fiat currencies are generally more stable because they are backed by the government's economic policies and resources.
- **Wide Acceptance:** Fiat currencies are universally accepted for transactions, both domestically and internationally.

### Cryptocurrencies {#cryptocurrencies}
- **Decentralized Control:** Cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any government or central bank. They operate on decentralized networks using blockchain technology.
- **Digital Form Only:** Cryptocurrencies exist solely in digital form and are transferred electronically.
- **Volatility:** Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, with prices fluctuating rapidly due to market demand and speculation.
- **Growing Acceptance:** While cryptocurrencies are increasingly accepted by businesses and individuals, they are not as widely recognized or used as fiat currencies.

# Example: How Bitcoin Works {#example-bitcoin}

To illustrate how blockchains and cryptocurrencies work, let's take Bitcoin as an example:

### 1. Making a Transaction {#making-a-transaction}

Suppose Alice wants to send 1 Bitcoin (BTC) to Bob. To do this, Alice uses her Bitcoin wallet, a software application that allows her to send and receive Bitcoin. She enters Bob's wallet address (a unique string of letters and numbers) and the amount she wants to send. The transaction is then broadcast to the Bitcoin network.

### 2. Transaction Verification {#transaction-verification}

Once Alice's transaction is broadcast to the network, it is grouped with other transactions into a block. This block is then sent out to the network of computers (nodes) that are part of the Bitcoin blockchain. These nodes verify the transaction by checking that Alice has enough Bitcoin in her wallet to make the transfer and that the transaction follows the rules of the network.

### 3. Adding the Block to the Blockchain {#adding-block-to-blockchain}

After the transactions in the block are verified, the block is added to the Bitcoin blockchain. This process involves solving a complex mathematical problem, which is done by miners, a special group of nodes. The first miner to solve the problem gets to add the block to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly created Bitcoin, as well as any transaction fees associated with the transactions in the block.

### 4. Finalizing the Transaction {#finalizing-transaction}

Once the block is added to the blockchain, the transaction is considered complete, and Bob's wallet is credited with 1 Bitcoin. The entire process typically takes around 10 minutes, but it can vary depending on network conditions.

### 5. Security and Immutability {#security-and-immutability}

Because the transaction is now part of the blockchain, it is secured and cannot be altered. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network ensures that the transaction is valid and that no one can tamper with the record. This process is what makes Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies secure and trustworthy.

### In Summary {#in-summary}

Blockchains are secure, transparent digital ledgers that form the foundation of cryptocurrencies, a new type of digital currency. Both blockchains and cryptocurrencies offer benefits like enhanced security, lower costs, and greater accessibility, but they also differ significantly from traditional fiat currencies, particularly in terms of control, form, and stability. Understanding these differences can help you navigate the world of digital finance and make informed decisions about using or investing in cryptocurrencies. The example of Bitcoin demonstrates how blockchain technology underpins the security and functionality of cryptocurrencies, making them a viable alternative to traditional money.
