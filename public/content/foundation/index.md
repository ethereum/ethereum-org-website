# Ethereum Foundation {#ethereum-foundation}

<Logo/>

The [Ethereum Foundation](http://ethereum.foundation/) (EF) is a non-profit organization that supports the [Ethereum](/) ecosystem. It funds protocol development, grows the ecosystem, and advocates for Ethereum.

The EF is not a company, or even a traditional non-profit. It does not control or lead Ethereum, nor is it the only organization that funds critical development of Ethereum-related technologies. The EF is one part of a much larger [ecosystem](/community/).

## What the EF does {#what-the-ef-does}

- **Protocol development** – Supporting teams working on Ethereum's core protocol, including client development, research, upgrades, and the [bug bounty program](/bug-bounty/)
- **Ecosystem funding** – Providing grants and support to projects building on Ethereum through the [Ecosystem Support Program](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/)
- **Research** – Funding research across cryptography, consensus, scaling, privacy, and security
