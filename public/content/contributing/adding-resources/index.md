# Adding Resources {#adding-resources}

We want to make sure we list the best resources possible while keeping users safe and confident.

Anyone is free to suggest new resources to add to the resource dashboard on ethereum.org, currently found at [ethereum.org/resources](/resources/).

Although we welcome new additions, the current resources were chosen based on an experience we're trying to create for our users. These are based on some of our design principles:

- _Inspirational_: anything on ethereum.org should offer something new to users
- _A good story_: what's listed should provide an "aha" moment
- _Credible_: everything should be legitimate businesses/projects to minimize risk to users

Overall **ethereum.org aims to provide a seamless onboarding experience for new users**. For that reason, we add resources based on their:

- ease of use
- accuracy
- maintenance

## The decision framework {#decision-framework}

### Criteria {#criteria}

- **Honest and accurate listing information** - Any suggested listings must come with honest and accurate information. Products that falsify information will be removed.
- **Active project** â€“ The resource should be maintained by an active team to ensure quality and support for users. Outdated resources are subject to removal.

### Product Ordering {#product-ordering}

We reserve the right to order products based on their impact. New products will generally be added to the bottom of the list unless otherwise specified.

## Maintenance {#maintenance}

As the Ethereum ecosystem evolves, we will routinely check our content to:

- Ensure that all resources listed still fulfill our criteria
- Verify there aren't products that have been suggested that meet more of our criteria than the ones currently listed

You can help with this by checking and letting us know. [Create an issue](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/new?template=bug_report.yaml) or send an email to [website@ethereum.org](mailto:website@ethereum.org).
