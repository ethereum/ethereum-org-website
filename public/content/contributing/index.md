- Commenting on an issue or PR in [GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website)

### A note on plagiarism {#plagiarism}

Only use your original work or content that you have permission to use when contributing any content or artifact to ethereum.org. Many projects within the Ethereum ecosystem use open-source licensing that allows for the free sharing of information. However, if you cannot find this information, do not attempt to add it to ethereum.org. Any pull requests deemed as plagiarism will get rejected.

## New to open-source? {#new-to-open-source}

We have low barrier to entry issues on our GitHub repository specifically designed for developers who are new to open-source labelled [good first issue](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## Claim your Onchain Achievement Token (OAT) {#oat}

If your contribution gets merged into ethereum.org, you will have a chance to claim a special badge on [Galxe](https://app.galxe.com/quest/ethereumorg). An Onchain Achievement Token (OAT) is a proof that you helped make the ecosystem a little more awesome.

[More on OATs](https://help.galxe.com/en/articles/9645630-create-quest-rewards#h_1c5d63ba03)

### How to claim

You should only use self-custody wallets to claim OATs. Do not use exchange accounts or other accounts you do not hold the private keys to, as these will not allow you to access and manage your OATs.
