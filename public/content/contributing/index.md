## How to work on ethereum.org {#how-to-update-content}

If you wish to contribute in the [Translation Program](/contributing/translation-program/), we ask you to create an account on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereum-org). For everything else – adding or editing content or visuals to the website, fixing bugs, working on open tasks – you will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

All updates are made via the GitHub PR process. This means you create a local copy of the website, make your changes and request to merge your changes. If you've never done this before, follow the instructions at the bottom of our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website).

You don't need permission to work on anything, but it's always best to let us know what you're planning to do. You can do this by:

- Commenting on an issue or PR in [GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website)
- Messaging on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ethereum-org)

Before contributing, make sure you're familiar with:

- the evolving [vision of ethereum.org](/about/)
- our [design principles](/contributing/design-principles/)
- our [style guide](/contributing/style-guide/)
- our [code of conduct](/community/code-of-conduct)

## How decisions about the site are made {#how-decisions-about-the-site-are-made}

Decisions about individual PRs, design evolution and major upgrades are made by a team from across the Ethereum ecosystem. This team includes project managers, developers, designers, marketing and communications, and subject matter experts. Community input informs every decision: so please raise questions in issues, submit PRs, or contact the team:

- [website@ethereum.org](mailto:website@ethereum.org)
- [@ethdotorg](https://twitter.com/ethdotorg)
- [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ethereum-org)

### A note on plagiarism {#plagiarism}

Only use your original work or content that you have permission to use when contributing any content or artifact to ethereum.org. Many projects within the Ethereum ecosystem use open-source licensing that allows for the free sharing of information. However, if you cannot find this information, do not attempt to add it to ethereum.org. Any pull requests deemed as plagiarism will get rejected.

## New to open-source? {#new-to-open-source}

We have low barrier to entry issues on our GitHub repository specifically designed for developers who are new to open-source labelled [good first issue](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## Claim your Onchain Achievement Token (OAT) {#oat}

If your contribution gets merged into ethereum.org, you will have a change to claim a special badge on [Galxe](https://galxe.com/ethereumorg/). An Onchain Achievement Token (OAT) is a proof that you helped make the ecosystem a little more awesome.

[More on OATs](https://help.galxe.com/en/articles/7067290-galxe-oats-reward-and-celebrate-achievements)

### How to claim
1. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ethereum-org).
2. Paste a link to your contribution in the `#🥇 | proof-of-contribution` channel
3. Wait for a member of our team to send you a link to your OAT.
4. Claim your OAT!

You should only use self-custody wallets to claim OATs. Do not use exchange accounts or other accounts you do not hold the private keys to, as these will not allow you to access and manage your OATs.

## Claim your GitPOAP {#claim-gitpoap}

GitPOAP will also automatically recognize your merged contribution and let you mint a separate unique contributors POAP on their platform itself!


### How to claim {#how-to-claim}

1. Visit [GitPOAP](https://www.gitpoap.io).
2. Connect with your wallet or even with your email through sign in option.
3. Search for your GitHub username, ETH address, ENS names or any GitPOAP to check if you're eligible.
