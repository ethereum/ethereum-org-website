# Translation Program {#translation-program}

The Translation Program is a collaborative effort to translate ethereum.org into different languages in order to make the website more accessible to billions of non-English speakers around the world.

## Help us translate {#help-us-translate}

The ethereum.org Translation Program is open and anyone can contribute!

1. You will need to log in to your Crowdin account or sign up.
2. Select the language you want to contribute to.
3. Before starting, please check out the [How to translate](/contributing/translation-program/how-to-translate/) guide to learn how to use Crowdin, and the [Translation Style Guide](/contributing/translation-program/translators-guide/) for tips and best practices.
4. Machine translations will not be approved.
5. All translations are reviewed before being added to the site, so there will be a short delay before your translations go live.

## About the Translation Program {#about-us}

The Ethereum community aims to be global and inclusive, yet much of its content only caters to English speakers, leaving out the world's 6 billion non-English speakers. For ethereum.org to act as the portal into Ethereum for the worldwide community, we believe providing non-English speakers with Ethereum content in their native languages is essential.

The ethereum.org Translation Program aims to make Ethereum accessible to everyone by translating ethereum.org and other Ethereum content into as many languages as possible.

## Starting your own translation program {#starting-a-translation-program}

We are dedicated to translating Ethereum content into as many languages as possible and making educational content available to everyone.
In line with our focus on translations, we want to help other Ethereum projects organize, manage, and improve their own translation efforts.

For this reason, we have created a [Translation Program playbook](/contributing/translation-program/playbook/) that contains some tips and best practices we have picked up in the process of translating ethereum.org.

Want to collaborate further or use some of our translation resources? Have any feedback on the playbook? We would love to hear from you at translations@ethereum.org.
