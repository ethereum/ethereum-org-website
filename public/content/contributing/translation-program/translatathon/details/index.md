The Translatathon is open and anyone can participate by filling out the application form and joining the project in Crowdin.

Translators collect points by suggesting translations for untranslated strings in their language in the Crowdin editor during the translation period.

Each participants final score is determined by their position on the leaderboard based on the number of words they have translated during the translation period and any potential bonus points they’ve collected.

## Getting started {#getting-started}

The translation process takes place in the ethereum.org project in Crowdin and translators suggest their translations for untranslated strings, made up of almost all the content from the ethereum.org website.

Translations are suggested directly in the online editor so there is no need to download or upload any files or deliverables. Each translated word is tracked and counted.

**1) Join the project**

- To start contributing, join the [ethereum.org project in Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereum-org)
- You will need to sign in or create an account - all that is required is an email address and password

**2) Select your language**

- Find your language on the list of target languages and open it by clicking on its name or flag
- If you would like to translate into a language that isn’t available, reach out to [Ethereum.org Team](https://crowdin.com/profile/ethdotorg) on Crowdin or send us an email to translations@ethereum.org and we will add additional target languages per request

**3) Open an untranslated file**

- Find the first untranslated file to start translating. The folders containing the source files are based on priority, so you should start translating the first folder that contains untranslated files
- Each file has a progress indicator showing how much of the translatable content in the file has been translated and approved… if translation progress for any file is below 100%, please translate it

**4) Translate the untranslated strings**

- When you open a file to translate, make sure you are only translating untranslated strings!
- Each string has a status indicator that shows whether it’s _Translated_, _Untranslated_, or _Approved_. If a source string already has a suggested translation in your language, there is no need to translate it
- You can also filter strings in the editor to show _Untranslated first_ or _Untranslated only_

For a detailed guide to navigating and using the Crowdin editor, we recommend that all Translatathon participants read our [How to translate](/contributing/translation-program/how-to-translate/) guide.

You can also find some tips and best practices by checking out our [translation style guide](/contributing/translation-program/translators-guide/).

**How points work**

Every Translatathon participant will earn points towards their final score by translating content in the ethereum.org Crowdin project and other eligible projects (the full list of eligible projects is available below).

The scoring is simple: **1 translated word = 1 point**

In order to receive your final points allocation, your suggested translations will need to pass the evaluation process, where professional reviewers will check each participant's translations to ensure they meet the minimum quality threshold and no machine or AI translations were used in the process.

## Ecosystem content {#ecosystem-content}

Since the ethereum.org translation program is active all the time, the translation progress in some target languages on the website is significantly higher than others.

In order to ensure that all Translatathon participants have an equal opportunity to translate as much content as they can and compete for the top prizes, the source content that is part of the Translatathon is not only limited to ethereum.org website content.

Participants translating any of the eligible projects will earn an equal amounts of points, 1 translated word in any project = 1 point.

Here is a list of all the eligible projects that are part of the 2025 Translatathon:

- [Ethereum.org](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereum-org)

- [Ethereum.org developer tutorials](https://crowdin.com/project/33388446abbe9d7aa21e42e49bba7f97)

- [EthStaker deposit CLI](https://crowdin.com/project/ethstaker-deposit-cli)

- [Eth Docker docs](https://crowdin.com/project/eth-docker-docs)

- [Remix IDE documentation](https://crowdin.com/project/remix-translation)

- [Remix LearnEth](https://crowdin.com/project/remix-learneth)

More eligible projects will be added soon.

## Evaluation process {#evaluation-process}

All translations will be subject to QA and feedback, where professional linguists will evaluate submissions based on quality and accuracy.

We will also be running **anti-machine translation measures** using some tools that automatically detect machine or AI translations.

While translation quality will not play a critical role in the scoring, any **participants found using machine or AI translations** or suggesting low-quality and inaccurate translations will not be eligible for prizes!

The evaluation period will take place between throughout September and the results will be announced on the ethereum.org community call on September 25th.

All translations will also be fully reviewed before being added to the website.
