## Introduction

We believe that Ethereum content and onboarding resources should be accessible to everyone, regardless of the language they speak.
To move closer to this goal, the ethereum.org translation program is an initiative to translate the website into as many languages as possible. 

As part of the translation program, we are organizing the 3rd edition of the Translatathon in order to incentivize translation contributions in less-active languages, increase the number of languages and amount of content available on the site, onboard new contributors and reward our existing ones.

If you are bilingual and want to help make Ethereum content more accessible while competing for prizes, read on to learn more!

  <h3 className="mt-6">How much time do I have to commit?</h3>
    As much as you want. The minimum threshold to be eligible for participatory prizes is 500 translated words, which takes about 1 hour to complete, while competing for the top prizes will require a larger time commitment.

    <h3 className="mt-6">Do I need to be familiar with Ethereum?</h3>
    No. While being familiar with Ethereum can help with your productivity and quality, the Translatathon is as much a learning experience as it is a competition, and everyone is invited to join and learn more about Ethereum while participating.
