# Content buckets {#content-buckets}

As mentioned in our [Translation Program overview](/contributing/translation-program/), we use 'content buckets' within Crowdin to get the highest priority content released first. When you check out a language to translate, for example, [German](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereum-org/de) you'll see folders for each content bucket.
