**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS BEFORE MINTING THE 10 YEARS OF ETHEREUM TORCH**

These terms and conditions constitute a binding agreement (the “**Agreement**”) between you (“**You**”) and the Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss foundation registered in Zug, Switzerland (the “**EF**”), governing Your minting and use of the non-fungible token known as the **10 Years of Ethereum Torch** (the “**NFT**”).
