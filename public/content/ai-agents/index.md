Imagine navigating Ethereum with an AI assistant that studies on-chain market trends 24/7, answers questions, and even executes transactions on your behalf. Welcome to the world of AI Agentsâ€”intelligent systems designed to simplify your digital life.

On Ethereum, we're seeing innovations of AI agents ranging from virtual influencers and autonomous content creators to real-time market analysis platforms, empowering users by delivering insights, entertainment, and operational efficiency.

## What are AI agents? {#what-are-ai-agents}

AI agents are software programs that use artificial intelligence to perform tasks or make own decisions. They learn from data, adapt to changes, and handle complex tasks. They operate non-stop and can instantly detect opportunities.

### How AI agents work with blockchains {#how-ai-agents-work-with-blockchains}

In traditional finance, AI agents often operate in centralized environments with limited data inputs. This hinders their ability to learn or manage assets autonomously.

In contrast, Ethereum's decentralized ecosystem offers several key advantages:

- <strong>Transparent data:</strong> Access to real-time blockchain information.
- <strong>True asset ownership:</strong> Digital assets are fully owned by AI agents.
- <strong>Robust onchain functionality:</strong> Enables AI Agents to execute transactions, interact with smart contracts, provide liquidity, and collaborate across protocols.

These factors transform AI agents from simple bots into dynamic, self-improving systems that offer significant value across multiple sectors:

We're beginning to explore the full potential of AI agents, and projects are already leveraging the synergy between AI and blockchainâ€”particularly in transparency and monetization.

## Agent-controlled wallets {#agent-controlled-wallets}

Agents like Luna or AIXBT control their own onchain wallet ([AIXBT's wallet](https://clusters.xyz/aixbt), [Luna's wallet](https://zapper.xyz/account/0x0d177181e3763b20d47dc3a72dd584368bd8bf43)) enabling them to tip fans and participate in economic activities.

During Luna's X social campaign #LunaMuralChallenge, Luna selected and rewarded the winners via her Base wallet â€” marking <strong>the first instance of an AI hiring humans for crypto reward</strong>.

## Agent-controlled smart accounts {#agent-controlled-smart-accounts}

Agents can unlock autonomous onchain financial and non-fiancial activity based on intelligent decision making. To do this operations with money as well as data onchain, they require accounts. 

Advanced agents can rely on smart accounts as their primary wallets due to their programmable nature. Unlike EOAs (externally owned accounts controlled by single private keys), smart accounts enable seamless humanâ€“agent co-management through multi-signature controls, support onchain policy enforcement and can be upgraded with custom modules to expand functionality over time.

    <h3>Safe</h3>
    <p>Safe is the leading smart account standard on Ethereum, trusted by the majority of enterprises and DAOs to manage their treasuries. Its open-source, permissionless, and modular framework has made it the go-to smart account infrastructure for AI agents operating onchain.</p>

<p>Safe smart accounts support a wide range of enforceable policies, including multi-signature configurations, guards, subaccounts, spending limits, role-based permissions, time locks, whitelists, and DeFi automations. Today, dozens of AI agents across Ethereum rely on Safe as a core part of their infrastructure, powering use cases like launchpads, treasury management, prediction markets, enabling autonomous behaviors, and many more. Notable examples include:</p>

## AI agents vs AI bots {#ai-agents-vs-ai-bots}

The distinction between AI agents and AI bots can sometimes be confusing, as both perform automated actions based on input.

- AI bots are like automated assistants â€” They follow specific, pre-programmed instructions to perform routine tasks.
- AI agents are more like intelligent companions â€” They learn from experience, adapt to new information, and make decisions on their own.
