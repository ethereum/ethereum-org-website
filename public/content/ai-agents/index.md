Imagine navigating Ethereum with an AI assistant that studies on-chain market trends 24/7, answers questions, and even executes transactions on your behalf. Welcome to the world of AI Agents—intelligent systems designed to simplify your digital life.

On Ethereum, we’re seeing innovations of AI agents ranging from virtual influencers and autonomous content creators to real-time market analysis platforms, empowering users by delivering insights, entertainment, and operational efficiency.

## What are AI agents? {#what-are-ai-agents}

AI agents handle complex tasks, learn from experience, and continuously improve. They operate non-stop and can instantly detect opportunities.

### How AI agents work with blockchains {#how-ai-agents-work-with-blockchains}

In traditional finance, AI agents often operate in centralized environments with limited data inputs. This hinders their ability to learn or manage assets autonomously.

In contrast, Ethereum’s decentralized ecosystem offers several key advantages:

- <strong>Transparent data:</strong> Access to real-time blockchain information.
- <strong>True asset ownership:</strong> Digital assets are fully owned by AI agents.
- <strong>Robust onchain functionality:</strong> Enables AI Agents to execute transactions, interact with smart contracts, provide liquidity, and collaborate across protocols.

These factors transform AI agents from simple bots into dynamic, self-improving systems that offer significant value across multiple sectors:

## Agent-controlled wallets {#agent-controlled-wallets}

Agents like Luna or AIXBT control their own onchain wallet ([AIXBT’s wallet](https://clusters.xyz/aixbt), [Luna’s wallet](https://zapper.xyz/account/0x0d177181e3763b20d47dc3a72dd584368bd8bf43)) enabling them to tip fans and participate in economic activities.

During Luna’s X social campaign #LunaMuralChallenge, Luna selected and rewarded the winners via her Base wallet — marking <strong>the first instance of an AI hiring humans for crypto reward</strong>.

## Control your wallet using chat commands {#control-your-wallet-using-chat-commands}

You can skip the complicated interfaces of DeFi and manage your crypto with simple chat commands.

This intuitive approach makes transactions faster, easier, and less prone to errors like sending funds to the wrong address or overpaying for fees.

## AI agents vs AI bots {#ai-agents-vs-ai-bots}

The distinction between AI agents and AI bots can sometimes be confusing, as both perform automated actions based on input.

- AI bots are like automated assistants — They follow specific, pre-programmed instructions to perform routine tasks.
- AI agents are more like intelligent companions — They learn from experience, adapt to new information, and make decisions on their own.
