## How onchain gaming works {#how-onchain-gaming-works}

Onchain games give players true ownership of in‑game assets. No central servers, no intermediaries—just transparent, player‑driven experiences and economy. Ethereum gives players true ownership of their in‑game items. These items exist as NFTs (non‑fungible tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain. That means:

- Players own their assets as NFTs.
- Items can be freely traded, gifted, or sold.
- Blockchain ensures assets remain accessible forever.
- Players can earn real‑world value from Play‑to‑Earn (P2E) gaming.

Play‑to‑earn (P2E) is also possible. Instead of just playing for fun, gamers can earn crypto rewards by playing Ethereum‑based games.

## The current state of gaming {#the-current-state-of-gaming}

- **Frustration Over Locked Assets:** [51% of gamers feel frustrated](https://www.starknet.io/blog/blockchain-gaming/) that they can’t gift or re‑sell in‑game items they buy, and 23% are annoyed by how difficult it is to recover money from in‑game purchases.
- **Frequent Game Shutdowns:** In 2023 alone, [60+ games were shut down](https://tech4gamers.com/game-studios-shut-down-2023/), and 11 game studios closed entirely, leaving players with nothing to show for their in‑game investments.
- **High Spending with No Return:** [Gamers spend an average of \$6,425](https://www.starknet.io/blog/blockchain-gaming/) on virtual items over their lifetime, with \$8.74 spent per month or \$104 per year.

## Popular games built on Ethereum {#popular-games-built-on-ethereum}

Developers are exploring new ways to make P2E more engaging and go beyond simple reward mechanics to deepen, skill‑based gameplay.

## Play-to-earn (P2E) {#play-to-earn-p2e}

With Play‑to‑Earn (P2E) games, you can earn assets with real value. Unlike early P2E models that relied on unsustainable rewards, newer games focus on long‑term value. For example, [Wolf Game](https://gam3s.gg/wolf-game/) combines strategic gameplay with real asset ownership. Players manage virtual sheep and wolves, earning the in‑game currency WOOL, which can be traded or sold.

## Interoperability & cross‑chain play {#interoperability-and-cross-chain-play}

While this is still in development, some game networks are already interoperable, where in‑game items (NFTs) can be used across multiple games.

For instance, in Illuvium, [players can collect creatures called Illuvials](https://gam3s.gg/news/illuvium-three-web3-games/), which are NFTs. These Illuvials can be used across various games within the Illuvium universe. An Illuvial captured in Illuvium Overworld can also be used in Illuvium Arena for battles.

Another example is Galaxy Fight Club. In this game, [players can use different NFT collections](https://gam3s.gg/galaxy-fight-club/) to participate in battles, meaning NFTs from various projects can be used within the game.

## Scalability & gas fee improvements {#scalability-and-gas-fee-improvements}

The challenge with most Ethereum gaming is high gas fees and slow transactions, which makes in‑game transactions costly. But this is changing thanks to Ethereum scaling networks (L2):

- Immutable X; Enables gas‑free NFT trading.
- Arbitrum & Optimism; Reduce fees and improve transaction speed.
- zkEVM solutions; Help process game‑related transactions faster.
