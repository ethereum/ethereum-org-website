# Page Visual Tests (Playwright + Chromatic)

This repo has two Chromatic projects: Storybook (`chromatic.yml` + `pnpm chromatic`) and **page visual tests** (`chromatic-pages.yml` + `pnpm chromatic:pages`). This skill is the second one only.

The Playwright suite captures DOM archives (not PNGs) per page × viewport; Chromatic re-renders them in the cloud to diff. A green local `pnpm test:visual` just means archives were produced — the diff happens after upload.

## Files that matter

- `playwright.visual.config.ts` — visual-only config (3 viewports + `webServer`)
- `playwright.config.ts` — base (e2e + unit; **no `webServer`**)
- `tests/visual/pages.spec.ts` — page list + readiness pattern
- `.github/workflows/chromatic-pages.yml` — CI
- `src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx`, `src/components/ui/spinner.tsx` — loading primitives
- `package.json` scripts: `test:visual*`, `chromatic:pages`

## Non-obvious constraints

**Dual Playwright config.** `webServer` lives only in `playwright.visual.config.ts`. Moving it into the base config breaks `pnpm test:unit` and `pnpm test:e2e` in CI — they try to start Next against a missing `.next` build.

**Desktop viewport is 1024, not 1280.** Chromatic caps snapshots at `width × height ≤ 25M` px. The tallest tested pages reach ~22.5k px; 1280 overflows, 1024 fits. Measure `document.documentElement.scrollHeight` before raising the viewport or adding a long page.

**Loading contract: `data-slot="loading"`.** The shared `Skeleton` and `Spinner` primitives carry this attribute. Each test waits until `document.querySelectorAll('[data-slot="loading"]').length === 0` before snapshotting. Any bespoke loader — raw `animate-pulse-light`, a local Skeleton copy, a custom spinner — is invisible to the wait and will silently flake. Fix by routing through the shared primitive or adding `data-slot="loading"` to the bespoke loader's root.

**Imports come from `@chromatic-com/playwright`, not `@playwright/test`.** The two packages re-export `expect` with skewed types, so `expect(...).toHaveCount(0)` misbehaves — prefer `page.waitForFunction` for the loading wait.

**Environment.** `USE_MOCK_DATA=true` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_LOCALES=en` are required at build and test time. All paths are `/en/...`.

**Use `domcontentloaded`, not `networkidle`.** Analytics and background fetches keep the network perpetually busy.

## Canonical test

```ts
import { takeSnapshot, test } from "@chromatic-com/playwright"

const pages: Array<{ name: string; path: string; stableSelector?: string }> = [
  { name: "Homepage", path: "/en/" },
  {
    name: "Docs - Smart Contracts",
    path: "/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/",
    stableSelector: "article#main-content", // DocsLayout renders no <main> wrapper
  },
  // ...
]

test.describe("Page Visual Tests", () => {
  for (const { name, path, stableSelector = "h1" } of pages) {
    test(name, async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
      await page.goto(path, { waitUntil: "domcontentloaded" })
      await page.locator(stableSelector).first().waitFor({ state: "visible" })
      await page.waitForFunction(
        () => document.querySelectorAll('[data-slot="loading"]').length === 0
      )
      await takeSnapshot(page, testInfo)
    })
  }
})
```

Override `stableSelector` when there's no visible `h1` above the fold or the layout wraps content unusually.

## Common situations

**Adding a page.** Each entry costs three snapshots (one per viewport) against Chromatic's budget, so check whether the page's layout (under `src/layouts/`) is already covered before adding. Scan the page subtree for bespoke loaders — they're the single biggest flake cause — and confirm full-page height stays under the 25M-pixel budget. Local loop: `pnpm test:visual:build` once, then `pnpm test:visual:desktop` for iteration, `pnpm test:visual` for the full sweep.

**Flaky snapshot.** The culprit is almost always a loader without `data-slot="loading"`. Run with `--trace=on` and inspect the `waitForFunction` step in the trace — if its duration is ~0 ms, the loader isn't being waited on. If dynamic content is drifting, double-check `USE_MOCK_DATA=true` is set in both build and test steps.

**Pixel-limit error.** Measure the page's full-page height at 1024 px; if it exceeds ~24,400 px, the page needs shortening or removal from the suite. Cropping to viewport was considered and rejected — it defeats the below-the-fold regression coverage that justifies using Playwright over Storybook here.

**Works locally, fails in CI.** Usually `HOME: /root` missing from the test step — GitHub Actions overrides `HOME` inside containers, and Playwright can no longer find the browsers baked into the `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright` image. Also check that the image tag matches `@playwright/test` in `package.json`.
