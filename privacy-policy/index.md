cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored.

<p>Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our websites users. The
purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our websites. The websites user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the websites is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.</p>

of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently
deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, previously set cookies may be deleted at
