# About ethereum.org {#about-ethereumorg}

ethereum.org is a public, open-source resource for the Ethereum community that anyone can contribute to. We have a small core team dedicated to maintaining and developing the site with contributions from thousands of community members across the globe.

**Nobody from ethereum.org will ever contact you. Do not respond.**

## A note on names {#a-note-on-names}

It's common for people to confuse names within the Ethereum landscape, which can lead to poor mental models about how Ethereum works. Here's a quick explainer to clear things up:

### Ethereum {#ethereum}

Ethereum is a public network, a blockchain, and an open-source protocol -- operated, governed, managed, and owned by a global community of tens of thousands of developers, node operators, ETH holders and users.

[More on Ethereum governance](/governance/)

### Ether (ETH) {#ether-or-eth}

Ether (also known by its ticker symbol, ETH) is the native currency transacted on Ethereum. ETH is needed to pay for usage of the Ethereum network (in the form of transaction fees). ETH is also used to secure the network with staking. When people talk about the price of Ethereum, they're referring to ETH the asset.

### Ethereum Foundation {#ethereum-foundation}

A non-profit organization, funded initially by the crowdsale of ETH, dedicated to the support of the Ethereum network and ecosystem.

### ethereum.org {#ethereum-org}

A public, open-source website and educational resource for the Ethereum community. ethereum.org is led by a small core team, funded by the Ethereum Foundation, with contributions from thousands of community members across the globe.

This page covers more information about ethereum.org.

## Our mission {#our-mission}

**ethereum.org's mission is to be the best portal for Ethereum's growing community**

We strive to build an easy-to-understand educational resource for all topics relating to Ethereum, designed to help new users become familiar with Ethereum and its key concepts. We want to:

- explain Ethereum to anyone new to the technology
- help new users get started with ETH and Ethereum
- help new developers to start building
- cover updates in the Ethereum world
- showcase resources created by the community
- bring Ethereum education to as many languages as possible

To achieve this mission, our team focuses on two primary goals on ethereum.org:

### 1. Improve user experience for ethereum.org visitors {#visitors}

- Extend, improve, and keep content up-to-date
- Improve usability and accessibility via localization and web development best practices
- Increase user engagement via features like surveys, quizzes, and web3 integrations
- Keep the website lightweight and performant

### 2. Grow, strengthen, and empower our community of contributors {#community}

- Grow total number of contributors to the website
- Improve contributor retention through engagement, acknowledgments, and rewards
- Empower community members to make increasingly significant contributions
- Facilitate greater diversity of contributions: code, content, design, translation, moderation
- Keep the codebase modern, clean, and well-documented

## Core principles {#core-principles}

We have some core principles that help guide us to accomplish our mission.

### 1. ethereum.org is a portal to Ethereum üåè {#core-principles-1}

We want our users to have their interest piqued and their questions answered. So our portal needs to combine information, "magic moments" and links to the brilliant community resources that exist out there. The purpose of our content is to be an ‚Äúonboarding portal‚Äù and not a substitute for the extensive resources that already exist. We're keen to support and integrate with community built resources, giving them more visibility and making them more discoverable.
[Ethereum's community](/community/) is at the heart of this: we need to not just serve the community, but work with them and incorporate their feedback. The website isn't just for the community we have now but for the community we hope to grow into. We must remember our community is global, containing people from many languages, regions, and cultures.

### 2. ethereum.org is always evolving üõ† {#core-principles-2}

Ethereum and the community are always evolving, so ethereum.org will too. That's why the site has a simple design system & modular structure. We make iterative changes as we learn more about how people use the site and what the community wants from it.
We're open source, with a community of contributors, so you can propose changes or help us out too.

### 3. ethereum.org is not a typical product website ü¶Ñ {#core-principles-3}

Ethereum is a big thing: it includes a community, a technology, a set of ideas and ideologies, and more.
This means the website needs to handle many different user journeys, from ‚Äúa developer who wants a specific tool‚Äù and ‚Äúa newcomer who just bought some ETH and doesn‚Äôt know what a wallet is".
"What is the best website for a blockchain platform?" remains an open question - we are pioneers. Building this requires experimentation.

## Product roadmap {#roadmap}

To make our work more accessible and to foster more community collaboration, the ethereum.org core team publishes an overview of our quarterly roadmap goals.

[View our 2024 Q3 product roadmap](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/13399)

**How's that sound?** We always appreciate feedback on our roadmap - if there's something you think we should work on, please let us know! We welcome ideas and PRs from anyone in the community.

## Design principles {#design-principles}

We use a set of [design principles](/contributing/design-principles/) to guide our content and design decisions on the site.

## Design system {#design-system}

We built and released a [design system](https://www.figma.com/file/NrNxGjBL0Yl1PrNrOT8G2B/ethereum.org-Design-System?node-id=0%3A1&t=QBt9RkhpPqzE3Aa6-1) to ship features more quickly and let community members participate in the open design of ethereum.org.

Want to get involved?¬†[Follow along in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/NrNxGjBL0Yl1PrNrOT8G2B/ethereum.org-Design-System), the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/6284)¬†and join the conversation in our¬†[#design Discord channel](https://discord.gg/ethereum-org).

## Style guide {#style-guide}

We have a [style guide](/contributing/style-guide/) to standardize certain aspects of writing content to make the contribution process smoother.

Make sure you read [our principles](/contributing/design-principles/) and [our style guide](/contributing/style-guide/) if you'd like to [contribute to the site](/contributing/).

We welcome feedback on our design principles, design system and the style guide. Remember, ethereum.org is for the community, by the community.

## Open jobs {#open-jobs}

Although this website is open-source and anyone can work on it, we do have a team dedicated to ethereum.org and other Ethereum Foundation web projects.

We'll post any job openings here. If you don't see a role here for you, head over to [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/ethereum-org) and let us know how you'd like to work with us!
