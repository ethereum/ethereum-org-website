## Introduction {#introduction}

Many Ethereum development standards focus on token interfaces. These standards help ensure smart contracts remain composable, so for instance when a new project issues a token, that it remains compatible with existing decentralized exchanges.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

- [Ethereum development standards](/developers/docs/standards/)
- [Smart contracts](/developers/docs/smart-contracts/)

## Token standards {#token-standards}

Here are some of the most popular token standards on Ethereum:

- [ERC-20](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) - A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies.

### NFT standards {#nft-standards}

- [ERC-721](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) - A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, like a deed for artwork or a song.
- [ERC-1155](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/) - ERC-1155 allows for more efficient trades and bundling of transactions – thus saving costs. This token standard allows for creating both utility tokens (such as $BNB or $BAT) and Non-Fungible Tokens like CryptoPunks.
