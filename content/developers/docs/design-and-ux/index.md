Are you new to designing with Ethereum? This is the right place for you. The Ethereum community has written resources to introduce you to web3 design and research basics. You'll learn about core concepts that may differ from other app designs you're familiar with.

Need a more basic understanding of web3 first? Check out [**Learn hub**](/learn/).

## Start with user research {#start-with-user-research}

Effective design goes beyond creating visually appealing user interfaces. It involves gaining a deep understanding of the user's needs, objectives, and driving factors. Therefore, we highly recommend that all designers adopt a design process, such as the [**double diamond process**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Diamond_(design_process_model)>), to ensure that their work is deliberate and intentional.
