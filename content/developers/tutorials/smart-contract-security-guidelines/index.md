Follow these high-level recommendations to build more secure smart contracts.

## Design guidelines {#design-guidelines}

The design of the contract should be discussed ahead of time, prior to writing any line of code.

### Documentation and specifications {#documentation-and-specifications}

Documentation can be written at different levels, and should be updated while implementing the contracts:

- **A plain English description of the system**, describing what the contracts do and any assumptions on the codebase.
- **Schema and architectural diagrams**, including the contract interactions and the state machine of the system. [Slither printers](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Printer-documentation) can help to generate these schemas.
- **Thorough code documentation**, the [Natspec format](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/natspec-format.html) can be used for Solidity.

### On-chain vs off-chain computation {#on-chain-vs-off-chain-computation}

- **Keep as much code as you can off-chain.** Keep the on-chain layer small. Pre-process data with code off-chain in such a way that verification on-chain is simple. Do you need an ordered list? Sort the list offchain, then only check its order onchain.

### Upgradeability {#upgradeability}

We discussed the different upgradeability solutions in [our blogpost](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/09/05/contract-upgrade-anti-patterns/). Make a deliberate choice to support upgradeability or not prior to writing any code. The decision will influence how you structure your code. In general, we recommend:

- **Favoring [contract migration](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/10/29/how-contract-migration-works/) over upgradeability.** Migration systems have many of the same advantages as upgradeable ones, without their drawbacks.
- **Using the data separation pattern over the delegatecallproxy one.** If your project has a clear abstraction separation, upgradeability using data separation will necessitate only a few adjustments. The delegatecallproxy requires EVM expertise and is highly error-prone.
- **Document the migration/upgrade procedure before the deployment.** If you have to react under stress without any guidelines, you will make mistakes. Write the procedure to follow ahead of time. It should include:
  - The calls that initiate the new contracts
  - Where are stored the keys and how to access them
  - How to check the deployment! Develop and test a post-deployment script.

## Implementation guidelines {#implementation-guidelines}

**Strive for simplicity.** Always use the simplest solution that fits your purpose. Any member of your team should be able to understand your solution.

### Function composition {#function-composition}

The architecture of your codebase should make your code easy to review. Avoid architectural choices that decrease the ability to reason about its correctness.

- **Split the logic of your system**, either through multiple contracts or by grouping similar functions together (for example, authentication, arithmetic, ...).
- **Write small functions, with a clear purpose.** This will facilitate easier review and allow the testing of individual components.

### Inheritance {#inheritance}

- **Keep the inheritance manageable.** Inheritance should be used to divide the logic, however, your project should aim to minimize the depth and width of the inheritance tree.
- **Use Slither’s [inheritance printer](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Printer-documentation#inheritance-graph) to check the contracts’ hierarchy.** The inheritance printer will help you review the size of the hierarchy.

### Events {#events}

- **Log all crucial operations.** Events will help to debug the contract during the development, and monitor it after deployment.

### Avoid known pitfalls {#avoid-known-pitfalls}

- **Be aware of the most common security issues.** There are many online resources to learn about common issues, such as [Ethernaut CTF](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/), [Capture the Ether](https://capturetheether.com/), or [Not so smart contracts](https://github.com/crytic/not-so-smart-contracts/).
- **Be aware of the warnings sections in the [Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).** The warnings sections will inform you about non-obvious behavior of the language.

### Dependencies {#dependencies}

- **Use well-tested libraries.** Importing code from well-tested libraries will reduce the likelihood that you write buggy code. If you want to write an ERC20 contract, use [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC20).
- **Use a dependency manager; avoid copy-pasting code.** If you rely on an external source, then you must keep it up-to-date with the original source.

### Testing and verification {#testing-and-verification}

- **Write thorough unit-tests.** An extensive test suite is crucial to build high-quality software.
- **Write [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither), [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) and [Manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore) custom checks and properties.** Automated tools will help ensure your contract is secure. Review the rest of this guide to learn how to write efficient checks and properties.
- **Use [crytic.io](https://crytic.io/).** Crytic integrates with GitHub, provides access to private Slither detectors, and runs custom property checks from Echidna.

### Solidity {#solidity}

- **Favor Solidity 0.5 over 0.4 and 0.6.** In our opinion, Solidity 0.5 is more secure and has better built-in practices than 0.4. Solidity 0.6 has proven too unstable for production and needs time to mature.
- **Use a stable release to compile; use the latest release to check for warnings.** Check that your code has no reported issues with the latest compiler version. However, Solidity has a fast release cycle and has a history of compiler bugs, so we do not recommend the latest version for deployment (see Slither’s [solc version recommendation](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#recommendation-33)).
- **Do not use inline assembly.** Assembly requires EVM expertise. Do not write EVM code if you have not _mastered_ the yellow paper.

## Deployment guidelines {#deployment-guidelines}

Once the contract has been developed and deployed:

- **Monitor your contracts.** Watch the logs, and be ready to react in case of contract or wallet compromise.
- **Add your contact info to [blockchain-security-contacts](https://github.com/crytic/blockchain-security-contacts).** This list helps third-parties contact you if a security flaw is discovered.
- **Secure the wallets of privileged users.** Follow our [best practices](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/11/27/10-rules-for-the-secure-use-of-cryptocurrency-hardware-wallets/) if you store keys in hardware wallets.
- **Have a response to incident plan.** Consider that your smart contracts can be compromised. Even if your contracts are free of bugs, an attacker may take control of the contract owner's keys.
