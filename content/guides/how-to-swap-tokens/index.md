# How to swap tokens

Are you tired of searching for an exchange that lists all your favorite tokens? You can swap most of the tokens using [decentralized exchanges](/glossary/#dex).

A token swap involves the exchange of two different assets that exist on the Ethereum network, for example swapping ETH for DAI (an [ERC-20](/glossary/#erc-20) token). The process is very fast and cheap. You will need to have a crypto wallet to swap tokens.

**Prerequisite:**

- have a [crypto wallet](/glossary/#wallet), you can follow this tutorial: [How to: "Register" an Ethereum account](/guides/how-to-create-an-ethereum-account/)
- add funds to your wallet

## 1. Connect your wallet to the decentralized exchange (DEX) of your choice

Some popular exchanges are:

- [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)
- [Sushiswap](https://www.sushi.com/swap)
- [1Inch](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/unified/swap/ETH/DAI)
- [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/swap)

## 2. Select the pair of tokens you wish to swap

For example, ETH and DAI. Make sure you have funds in one of the two tokens.

## 5. Wait for the transaction to be processed

You can view the progress of the transaction on any blockchain explorer. This process should not take longer than 10 minutes.

You will automatically receive the swapped tokens in your wallet once the transaction is processed.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I swap ETH for BTC from my wallet?

No, you can only swap tokens that are native to the Ethereum network, such as ETH, ERC-20 tokens or NFTs. You can only swap "wrapped" forms of Bitcoin that live on Ethereum.

### What is slippage?

It is the difference between your expected exchange rate and the actual rate.
