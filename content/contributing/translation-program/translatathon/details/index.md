The Translatathon is open and anyone can participate by filling out the application form and joining the project in Crowdin.

Translators collect points by suggesting translations for untranslated strings in their language in the Crowdin editor during the translation period (August 9th - August 18th).

Each participants final score is determined by the number of words they have translated during the translation period and any potential multipliers they’ve collected.

### Getting started

The translation process takes place in the ethereum.org project in Crowdin and translators suggest their translations for untranslated strings, made up of almost all of content from the ethereum.org website.

Translations are suggested directly in the online editor so there is no need to download or upload any files or deliverables. Each translated word is tracked and counted.

**1) Join the project**

- To start contributing, you will need to join the [ethereum.org project in Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereum-org)
- You will need to sign in or create an account - all that is required is an email address and password

**2) Select your language**

- Find your language on the list of target languages and open it by clicking on its name or flag
- If you would like to translate into a language that isn’t available, reach out to [Ethereum.org Team](https://crowdin.com/profile/ethdotorg) on crowdin or send us an email to translations@ethereum.org and we will add new additional target languages per request

**3) Open an untranslated file**

- Find the first untranslated file to start translating. The folders containing the source files are based on priority - 1) Homepage, 2) Essential learning, 3) Essentials, 4) Exploring, etc. so you should start translating the first folder that contains untranslated files
- Each file has a progress indicator showing how much of the translatable content in the file has been translated and approved… if translation progress for any file is below 100%, please translate it

**4) Translate the untranslated strings**

- When you open a file to translate, make sure you are only translating untranslated strings!
- Each string has a status indicator that shows whether it’s _Translated_, _Untranslated_, or _Approved_. If a source string already has a suggested translation in your language, there is no need to translate it
- You can also filter strings in the editor to show _Untranslated first_ or _Untranslated only_

For a detailed guide to navigating and using the Crowdin online editor, we recommend all Translatathon participants to read our [How to translate](/contributing/translation-program/how-to-translate/) guide.

### Prizes

<TranslatathonPrizes />

**How points work**

Every Translatathon participant will earn points towards their final score by translating content in the ethereum.org Crowdin project and other eligible projects (the full list of eligible projects is available in the next section).

The scoring is simple: **1 translated word = 1 point**

Please note that in order to receive your final points allocation, your suggested translations will need to pass the evaluation process, where professional reviewers will check each participant's translations to ensure they meet the minimum quality threshold and no machine or AI translations were used in the process.

**Bonus points**

This year, Translatathon participants also have several options to earn bonus points.

Bonus points breakdown:
- ETHglossary contributors: 100-1,000 bonus points
- Ethereum.org contributors: 1,000 bonus points
- Previous Translatathon participants: 1,000 bonus points

1) ETHglossary translators
[ETHglossary](https://ethglossaryproject.vercel.app/) is an open-source glossary of key Ethereum terms, and an initiative to create and maintain a glossary of Ethereum terms and their translations in 60+ languages that anyone can use and contribute to.
Translatathon participants can suggest translations for these terms and vote or discuss existing translations to earn bonus points in the Translathon.
Each 10 translated terms will earn you 100 bonus points, with a bonus for completing all 70 terms currently available in the glossary app. The bonus points will be automatically added to your final score once the Translatathon ends and the final scores are calculated.

Participants can earn a maximum of 1,000 bonus points by translating all of the terms in their native language, but translating multiple languages will not result in any additional points!

ETHglossary points breakdown:
- 10 translated terms = 100 bonus points
- 20 translated terms = 200 bonus points
- 30 translated terms = 300 bonus points
- 40 translated terms = 400 bonus points
- 50 translated terms = 500 bonus points
- 60 translated terms = 600 bonus points
- 70 translated terms = 1,000 bonus points

2) Ethereum.org contributors
To reward our existing contributors, each past ethereum.org contributor is eligible for 1,000 bonus points.
Contributors are individuals that have received any ethereum.org contributor POAP, OAT or GitPOAP in the past.
You can check out the full list of eligible contributor POAPs, OATs and GitPOAPs [here](https://efdn.notion.site/Ethereum-org-contributor-credentials-1c23938dfd7f44d0bda3992c58897d63)

3) Previous Translatathon participants
Previous Translatathon participants will also receive 1,000 bonus points.
Anyone who participated in the 2023 edition of the ethereum.org Translatathon and scored at least 100 points, will automatically receive their bonus points once the Translatathon ends and the final scores are calculated.

**In order to claim their bonus points, participants must score at least 100 points in the 2024 Translatathon!**

### Ecosystem content

Since the ethereum.org Translation program is active throughout the year, the translation progress in some target languages on the website is significantly higher than others.

In order to ensure that all Translatathon participants have an equal opportunity to translate as much content as they can and compete for the top prizes, the source content that is part of the Translatathon is not only limited to ethereum.org website content.

Participants translating any of the eligible projects will earn an equal amounts of points, 1 translated word in any project = 1 point.

Here is a list of all the eligible projects that are part of the 2024 Translatathon:

### Evaluation process

All translations will be subject to QA and feedback, where professional linguists will evaluate submissions based on quality and accuracy.

We will also be running **anti-machine translation measures**, with Crowdin providing some tools that automatically detect machine translations.

While translation quality will not play a critical role in the scoring, any **participants found using machine translation** or suggesting low-quality and inaccurate translations **will be disqualified** and not eligible to compete for prizes!

The evaluation period will take place between August 19th-28th and the results will be announced on the ethereum.org community call on August 29th.

All translations will also be subject to a thorough review before being added to the website.
