## Introduction

The ethereum.org Translation Program is an ongoing effort to translate the website into as many languages as possible. We believe that Ethereum content and onboarding resources should be accessible to everyone, regardless of the language they speak.

As part of the Translation Program, we are organizing the second edition of the Translatathon with the aim of incentivizing translation contributions in less-active languages, increasing the number of languages and amount of content available on the site, onboard new contributors and reward our existing ones.

If you are bilingual and want to help make Ethereum content more accessible while competing for prizes, read on to learn more!

    <h3>How much time do I have to commit?</h3>
    As much as you want. The minimum threshold to be eligible for participatory prizes is 100 translated words, which takes about 10-20 minutes to complete, while competing for the top prizes will require a larger time commitment.

    <h3>Do I need to be familiar with Ethereum?</h3>
    No. While being familiar with Ethereum can help with your productivity and quality, the Translatathon is as much a learning experience as it is a competition, and everyone is invited to join and learn more about Ethereum while participating.
