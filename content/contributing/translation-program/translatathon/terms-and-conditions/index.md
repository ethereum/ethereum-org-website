## Modification and Termination.

We reserve the right to modify the rules or to terminate the Translatathon at any time, without prior notice. All changes will be effective immediately upon announcement.

## Eligibility, Judging, and Prizes

The determination of eligibility, scoring and judging methodology, and prize distribution fall solely and irrevocably under our discretion.

## Data Privacy

By submitting the application form, applicants and participants confirm that they have read and agree to our Privacy Policy and consent to share with us the requested information, which may include information that constitutes personal data. We will keep all information provided confidential, except for the participants’ provided Crowdin usernames and profile images which may be used in public announcements related to competition results and winners.

## Translation Standards

The use of machine translation tools, as determined by us in our sole discretion, may result in disqualification from the competition. In addition, the submission of incorrect and/or inaccurate translations, as determined by us in our sole discretion, may result in ineligibility for prize consideration. Further, any contributions towards strings that have already been translated or reviewed, as determined by us in our sole discretion, will not be included in the participants’ final score. We reserve the right to make such determinations, which shall be final and binding.

## Intellectual Property

Further, participants agree that their translation works may be made publicly available on the ethereum.org website under an open-source licence, including a Creative Commons licence, which allows others to use, share, and build upon the work.
