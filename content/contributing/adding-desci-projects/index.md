# Adding projects {#adding-projects}

We want to make sure we show a variety of projects and give a good snapshot of the DeSci landscape.

Anyone is free to suggest a project to list on the DeSci page on ethereum.org. Equally, anyone who notices a project that is no longer relevant or no longer meets our eligibility criteria is free to suggest its removal.

## The decision framework {#the-decision-framework}

### Criteria for inclusion: the must-haves {#the-must-haves}

- **Open source code/data** - Openness of code and data is a core DeSci principle, so DeSci projects must not be closed source. The codebase should be accessible and ideally open to PRs.
- **DeSci projects should be demonstrably decentralized** - This could include being governed by a DAO, or by building with a decentralized tech stack including non-custodial wallets. It probably involves auditable smart contracts on Ethereum.
- **Honest and accurate listing information** - It is expected that any suggested listings from projects come with honest and accurate information. Products that falsify listing information, such as declaring your product is “open source” when it is not, will be removed.
- **Demonstrable commitment to widening access to science** - A DeSci project should be able to articulate how they widen participation in science to the general public, not just to token/NFT holders.
- **Globally accessible** - Your project doesn’t have geographic limitations or KYC requirements that exclude certain people from accessing your service.
- **Informative website and documentation** - It is important that visitors to the project website can understand what the project actually does, how it contributes to decentralization of science infrastructure and how to participate.
- **Project should be part of the Ethereum ecosystem** - At ethereum.org we believe Ethereum (and its Layer 2's) to be the appropriate base layer for the DeSci movement.
- **The project is fairly well established** - The project has real users that have been able to access the project's services for several months.

### Nice-to-haves

- **Available in multiple languages** - Your project is translated into multiple languages allowing users around the world to access it.
- **Educational resources** - Your product should have a well-designed onboarding experience to help and educate users. Or evidence of how-to content like articles or videos.
- **Third-party audits** - Your product has been professionally audited for vulnerabilities by a trusted third party.
- **Point of contact** - A point of contact for the project (this might be by a representative from a DAO or community) will greatly help us get accurate information when changes are made. This will keep updating ethereum.org manageable when gathering future information.

## Maintenance {#maintenance}

As is the fluid nature of Ethereum, teams and products come and go and innovation happens daily, so we'll undertake routine checks of our content to:

- Ensure that all projects listed still fulfil our criteria
- Verify there aren't products that have been suggested that meet more of our criteria than the ones currently listed

Ethereum.org is maintained by the open source community & we rely on the community to help keep this up to date. If you notice any information about listed projects that needs to be updated, please open an issue or a pull request on our GitHub repository.

## Terms of use {#terms-of-use}
