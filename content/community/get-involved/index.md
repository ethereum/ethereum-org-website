## Non-technical skillsets <Emoji text=":briefcase:" size={1} />‍ {#non-technical}

If you’re not a developer, it can be hard to know where to start in Ethereum. Here are a few suggestions, along with resources for specific professional backgrounds.

### Organize a meetup in your city {#meetups}

- Not sure how to start? The [BUIDL network](https://consensys.net/developers/buidlnetwork/) can help.

### Write content about Ethereum {#write-content}

- Ethereum needs good writers who can explain its value in plain language
- Not ready to publish your own articles? Consider contributing to the existing content on community resources, or [propose new content for ethereum.org](/contributing/)!

### Offer to take notes for community calls {#take-notes}

- There are many open-source community calls, and having notetakers is a huge help. If you’re interested, join the [Ethereum Cat Herders discord](https://discord.com/invite/Nz6rtfJ8Cu), and introduce yourself!

### Translate Ethereum content into your native language {#translate-ethereum}

- ethereum.org maintains a Translation Program that translates the website, and other resources, into many different languages
- Find out how to get involved [here](/contributing/translation-program)

### Run a node {#run-a-node}

Join thousands of node operators in helping to further decentralize Ethereum.

- [More on how to run a node](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node/)

### Stake your ETH {#staking}

By staking your ETH you can earn rewards whilst helping to secure the Ethereum network.

- [More on staking](/staking/)

### Support projects {#support-projects}

The Ethereum ecosystem is on a mission to fund public goods and impactful projects. With very small donations you can show your support and allow important work to be realized.

## Financial professionals & Accountants <Emoji text=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" size={1} />‍ {#financial-professionals}

- Accountant? Assets on Ethereum - ETH, tokens, DeFi, etc - introduce many novel accounting issues. You could start by checking out some projects that aim to help users of cryptocurrency solve their bookkeeping & accounting challenges, like [Rotki](https://rotki.com/)

## Join a DAO {#decentralized-autonomous-organizations-daos}

"DAOs" are decentralized autonomous organizations. These groups leverage Ethereum technology to facilitate organization and collaboration. For instance, for controlling membership, voting on proposals, or managing pooled assets. While DAOs are still experimental, they offer opportunities for you to find groups that you identify with, find collaborators, and grow your impact on the Ethereum community. [More on DAOs](/dao/)
