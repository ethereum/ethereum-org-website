# GitHub Issue Triage Process

This document outlines how issues are triaged in the ethereum.org GitHub repository.

## 📥 Issue Creation

When a new issue is opened, it is automatically labeled with `needs triage 📥`.  
This label indicates that the core team needs to review the issue. **No one should work on it until it's triaged** to prevent unnecessary work.

Once reviewed by a core contributor, the label is removed.

## 🛠️ Triage Workflow

The core team reviews all `needs triage 📥` issues within **5 days**. An issue is considered triaged if one of the following happens:

1. ❌ The issue is closed — unnecessary, duplicate, or spam.
2. 💬 The issue requires further discussion — labeled `GH grooming`, to be discussed in the next GitHub grooming call. Afterward, action items will be added, and the issue considered triaged.
3. ✅ The issue is labeled appropriately (e.g., `design required`, `dev required`, etc.) and marked as ready for assignment.

After triage, the `needs triage 📥` label is removed.

## 👥 Assignment Process

Once triaged, the issue can be assigned. Priority is as follows:

1. 🔹 A core team member  
2. 🔹 The original author (if they volunteer)  
3. 🔹 Community contributor (a `help-wanted` label will be added)
