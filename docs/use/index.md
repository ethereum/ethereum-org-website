## 2. What is ETH, and how do I get it? {#2-what-is-eth-and-how-do-i-get-it}

ETH is Ethereum's native currency. It is "digital money" that can be sent over the internet instantly and cheaply, and also be used in many Ethereum-based applications like the ones above.

The easiest way to get ETH is to buy some. There are many cryptocurrency exchanges that will allow you to buy ETH, but the one you should use will depend on where you live and how you want to pay.
