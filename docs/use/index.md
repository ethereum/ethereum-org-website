## 1. Use an application built on ethereum

The best way to get started with Ethereum is to jump right in! There are many Ethereum-based applications that you can use today.

Here are just a few apps built on Ethereum - we rotate this list frequently!


- [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co), a network of incentivized open-source developers
- [Cent](https://beta.cent.co), a social network where you earn money by posting
- [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co), a game where you collect and breed digital collectible cats
- [DAI](https://makerdao.com/en/), a stable cryptocurrency that holds value at $1 USD

Some of these applications might require a wallet - [see the section below for more information.](./#_3-what-is-a-wallet-and-which-one-should-i-use)

## 2. What is ETH, and how do I get it?

ETH is Ethereum's native currency. It is "digital money" that can be sent over the internet instantly and cheaply, and also be used in many Ethereum-based applications like the ones above.

The easiest way to get ETH is to buy some. There are many cryptocurrency exchanges that will allow you to buy ETH, but the one you should use will depend on where you live and how you want to pay.
