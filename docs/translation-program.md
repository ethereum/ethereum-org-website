# Translation Program

_The Translation Program is an initiative to translate ethereum.org into different languages and make the website accessible to people from all over the world._

If you are looking to get involved as a translator, you can [join our project in Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereum-org/invite/) and start translating the website to your language immediately.

To get more information about the program, learn how to use Crowdin, check on the progress or find some useful tools for translators, please visit the [Translation Program page](https://ethereum.org/en/contributing/translation-program/).
